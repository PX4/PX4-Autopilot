5.19 2011-03-12 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* Initial version of the apps/ directory was released as contributed by
	  Uros Platise.

6.0 2011-03-21 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* README.txt -- README cosmetics
	* hello/ -- hello world minor changes
	* Makefile -- Makefile cosmetics (I am slowly adding the Darjeeling JVM)
	* Make.defs -- New file adds common make definitions for applications.
	* hello/Makefile -- Now uses new Make.defs definitions.  Added README.txt.
	* apps/poweroff -- New application to turn off board power.
	* Moved NSH library, netutils, and examples from the nuttx/ directory to
	  the apps/ directory
	* Moved exec_nuttapp machinery into the nuttapp/ directory.

6.1 2011-04-10 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* Creation of auto-generated header files now occurs during the context
	  build phase.
	* Added sdcard insert and eject, nsh command '?' and some code remarks
	* Renamed nuttapp to namedapp
	* namedapp/binfs.c -- Create a tiny filesystem that can be used
	  to show the internal named apps under /bin.
	* Numerous fixes to build system required to support building with native
	  Windows toolchain.

6.2 2011-05-06 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/nxffs:  Add a test a a configuration that will be used to
	  verify NXFFS.

6.3 2011-05-15 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/interpreter: Add a directory to hold interpreters.  The Pascal add-
	  on module now installs and builds under this directory.
	* apps/interpreter/ficl: Added logic to build Ficl (the "Forth Inspired
	  Command Language").  See http://ficl.sourceforge.net/.
	* apps/netutils/dhcpc, dhcpcd, and tftp.  If these directories are included
	  in the configuration but CONFIG_NET_UDP is disable (which is not very wise),
	  then a make error occurs because tools/mkdep.sh is called with no files.
	* system/free: Move Uros' custom free command from vsn/free
	* system/install: Add a new install command submitted by Uros Platise.
	* examples/rgmp.  Add a placeholder for an RGMP build example.
	  RGMP is a project for running GPOS and RTOS simultaneously on
	  multi-processor platforms. See http://rgmp.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page
	  for further information about RGMP.  NOTE:  This is an empty example
	  on initial check-in.

6.4 2011-06-06 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* nshlib/nsh_netcmds.c: If a network device name and IP address are provided
	  with the ifconfig command, then this command will now set the network address.
	  (Contributed by Yu Qiang).
	* netutils/ftpc: A library to support client-side FTP.
	* examples/ftpc: A simple add-on to the NSH.  From NSH, you can start
	  this simple FTP shell to transfer files to/from a remote FTP server.

6.5 2011-06-21 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* netutils/ftpc:  Simpflication and size reduction.

6.6 2011-07-11 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* Make.defs, namedapp/namedapp.c: Several structural changes made to get a
	  clean compile under the ez80 ZDS-II toolchain (no design changes).
	* apps/examples/buttons: Add a test for the new standardized button interfaces
	* apps/examples/nxtext: Add another NX graphics test.  This one focus on
	  placing text on the background while pop-up windows occur.  Text should
	  continue to update normally with or without the popup windows present.

6.7 2011-08-02 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/nx and nxtext:  These examples can now be built as NSH
	  "built-in" commands.
	* apps/examples/nxhello:  The simplest graphics example:  It just says
	  "Hello, World!" in the center of the display. This example can also be
	  built as an NSH "built-in" command.
	* apps/examples/nx, ntext, and nxhello:  All updated to use the new
	  NuttX font interfaces.
	* apps/examples/nximage:  Another super simple  graphics example:  It just puts
	  the NuttX logo in the center of the display. This example can also be
	  built as an NSH "built-in" command.
	* apps/examples/usbstorage: Can now be built as two NSH "built-in" commands:
	  'msconn' will connect the USB mass storage device; 'msdis' will disconnect
	  the USB storage device.
	* apps/examples/nx*:  All NX header files moved from nuttx/include/nuttx to 
	  nuttx/include/nuttx/nx.
	* apps/examples/usbstorage: Added instrumentation to monitor memory usage
	  to check for memory leaks in the USB storage driver.
	* apps/examples/nxhello/nxhello_bkgd.c:  Fix handling of allocated glyph
	  memory.

6.8 2011-08-11 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/nxlines:  Added a test for NX line drawing capabilities.

6.9 2011-09-11 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/nxlines:  Extend the line drawing text to include drawing
	  of circles.
	* apps/system/i2c:  Add an I2C test tool that should help to bring up I2C
	  devices (when it is fully functional).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_timcmds.c:  Add the date command that can be used to
	  show or set the time (only if CONFIG_RTC is set).

6.10 2011-10-06 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/system/i2c:  Add repitition and address auto-incrementing so that
	  and command can be executed numerous times.  Add a new verify command
	  that will write to a register, read from register, and verify that
	  returned value.
	* apps/graphics/tiff:  Add a library that can be used to create TIFF files.
	* apps/examples/tiff:  Add a unit test for the TIFF file creation logic
	* apps/examples/lcdrw:  Add a test to verify if you can or can or read
	  data from an LCD correctly.
	* apps/examples/usbterm:  A USB terminal example.. more of a USB chat or
	  serial bridge:  Data received on local console echoed via USB serial; 
	  data received on USB serial is echoed on the local console.
	* apps/examples/touchscreen:  Add a simple, generic test for any
	  touschscreen driver.
	* Makefile:  The apps/ Makefile now checks for an apps/external directory
	  or symbolic link.  If such a directory/link exists (and has a Makefile),
	  it will be added to the apps/ build.  This allows external directories
	  to be included into the apps/ build by simply creating a symbolic link.

6.11 2011-11-12 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	(No major changes from 6.10)

6.12 2011-12-06 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/buttons:  The button test can now be executed as an NSH
	  built in command.

6.13 2012-12-26 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/dhcpd: May now be built as an NSH built-in application
	  by setting CONFIG_NSH_BUILTIN_APPS.
	* apps/netutils/dhcpd/dhcpd.c: Fix several problems using host order address
	  where network addresses expected (and vice versa).
	* apps/examples/nettest: May now be built as an NSH built-in application
	  by setting CONFIG_NSH_BUILTIN_APPS.
	* apps/examples/nettest: Correct some build issues with the nettest is
	  built for performance evaluation.
	* apps/examples/adc:  Add a very simple test to drive and test an ADC
	  driver.
	* apps/examples/pwm:  Add an NSH PWM command to drive and test a PWM
	  driver.
	* apps/examples/can:  Add an NSH CAN command to drive and test a CAN
	  driver in loopback mode.

6.14 2012-01-15 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/buttons/main.c:  The test needs to call up_buttoninit() to
	  properly configure the button interrupt GPIOs.
	* apps/examples/pwm:  Add support to test the pulse count option recently
	  added to the PWM interface.

6.15 2012-02-12 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/nshlib/nsh_serial.c and nsh_usbdev.c:  If NuttX is configured to use
	  a USB serial console, then NSH needs to wait until the USB console is
	  connected and available.
	* apps/examples/composite:  Add a test of the USB composite device.
	* apps/examples/Telnetd:  Move the tiny uIP shell example from
	  netutils/Telnetd to examples/Telnetd.  Enhanced the Telnetd daemon so that
	  it supports Telnetd via a TTY device driver: A new TTY device driver is
	  created when each new Telnet connection is created.  The shell thread
	  is started with stdin, stdout, and stderr mapped to the TTY device.
	* netutils/Telnetd:  The old uIP Telnet demo is gone.  In its place is a new
	  Telnet infrastructure. The new Telnet daemon creates sessions that are
	  "wrapped" as character devices and mapped to stdin, stdout, and stderr.
	  Now the Telnet session can be inherited by spawned tasks.
	* examples/Telnetd:  Add a test for the new Telnet daemon.
	* examples/Telnetd/telnetd_driver.c: Move the internal socket structure from
	  the daemon's socket array into the driver's state data so that it will be
	  independent from the the Telnetd daemon.
	* apps/system/readline:  Moved the old nuttx/lib/stdio/lib_fgets.c here
	  and renamed it as readline().  The old fgets was simplied and the overloaded
	  readline functionality was removed.
	* apps/netutils/ftpd:  Add an FTPD server (does not even compile on initial
	  checkin).
	* apps/examples/ftpd:  Add a test for the FTPD server (untest on initial
	  check-in).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_fscmds.c:  Add support for a 'dmesg' command that will
	  dump the system log if CONFIG_SYSLOG is selected.

6.16 2012-03-10 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/qencoder:  Add a quadrature driver test.
	* apps/examples/ostest/fpu.c:  Add a test to verify that FPU registers
	  are properly saved and restored on context switches.
	* apps/system/readline/readline.c:  readline() will now treat either a
	  backspace or a DEL character as a backspace (i.e., deleting the character
	  to the left of the cursor).  This makes NSH less dependent on particular
	  keyboard mappings of the Backspace key.  Submitted by Mike Smith.
	* apps/examples/cdcacm:  An example that illustrates how the CDC/ACM driver
	  may to connected and disconnected through software control.
	* apps/examples/nsh/nsh_main.c:  If available, call up_cxxinitialize() to
	  initialize all statically defined C++ classes.
	* apps/nshlib:  Now supports a USB serial device for NSH console I/O.  This
	  allows NSH to be used on boards that have USB but no serial connectors.

6.17 2012-04-14 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/can:  Add conditional compilation so that the test can be
	  configured to only send messages or to only receive messages.  This will
	  let the test work in other modes than simple loopback testing.
	* apps/examples/hello and apps/examples/ostest:  Can now be built as NSH
	  built-int functions.
	* vsn/hello:  Removed.  The modified apps/examples/hello is enough "Hello,
	  World!"
	* apps/examples/nxconsole:  Add a test of the NX console device.
	* apps/examples/nxconsole:  The NX console example now supports running
	  the NuttShell (NSH) within an NX window.
	* apps/system/readline:  Now uses standard definitions from
	  include/nuttx/ascii.h and vt100.h
	* Kconfig, */Kconfig:  Added skeleton Kconfig files to all directories that
	  may need them.

6.18 2012-05-19 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* Kconfig:  Continued Kconfig file updates (no longer tracking on a per-file
	  basis in the ChangeLog)
	* apps/examples/watchdog:  Add a watchdog timer example.
	* apps/examples/tiff:  Fix wrong path used for temporary file.
	* apps/examples/touchscreen:  Standardize the board-specific, touchscreen
	  initialization interfaces.

6.19 2012-06-15 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/nshlib/nsh_usbdev.c:  Add the capability to use an arbitrary USB
	  device as the console (not necessarily /dev/console).  This is a useful
	  option because then you can still use the serial console to debug with.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_usbdev.c:  User now has to press ENTER 3 times before
	  USB console will start.  Otherwise, the USB console starts before there
	  is anyone at the other end to listen.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_usbdev.c and nsh_consolemain.c:  Add support for the USB
	  capability when a USB console is used.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_fscmds.c:  Add the 'mv' command

6.20 2012-07-12 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* namedapp/exec_namedapp.c - Correct an error when round robin scheduling
	  is enabled.  The priority of the new, named application was erroneously
	  being set to the priority of the parent thread; losing its configured
	  priority.  Reported by Mike Smith.

6.21 2012-08-25 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/include/: Stylistic clean-up of all header files.
	* apps/modbus and apps/include/modbus:  A port of freemodbus-v1.5.0
	  has been added to the NuttX apps/ source tree.
	* apps/examples/modbus:  A port of the freemodbus-v1.5.0 "demo"
	  program that will be used to verify the FreeModBus port
	* apps/modbus:  Don't use strerror().  It is just too big.
	* apps/modbus:  Add CONFIG_MB_TERMIOS.  If the driver doesn't support
	  termios ioctls, then don't bother trying to configure the baud, parity
	  etc.
	* apps/nshlib:  If waitpid() is supported, then NSH now catches the
	  return value from spawned applications (provided by Mike Smith)
	* apps/nshlib:  Lock the scheduler while starting built-in applications
	  in order to eliminate race conditions (also from Mike Smith).
	* apps/examples/adc, pwm, and qencoder:  Add support for testing
	  devices with multiple ADC, PWM, and QE devices.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_mntcmds.c:  Separated mount-related commands out of
	  nsh_fscmds.c.  Extended to the mount command so that if no arguments
	  are provided, then the current mountpoints are enumerated.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_mntcmds.c:  Add an NSH df command to list the
	  properties of mounted file systems.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_parse.c:  Extend help command options.  'help' with
	  no arguments outputs a short list of commands.  With -v lists all
	  command line details.  A command name can be added to just get
	  help on one command.
	* system/readline.c:  If character input/output is interrupted by a
	  signal, then readline() will try the read/write again.
	* apps/*/Make.defs:  Numerous fixes needed to use the automated
	  configuration (from Richard Cochran).

6.22 2012-09-29 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/netutils/thttpd/thttpd_cgi.c:  Missing NULL in argv[]
	  list (contributed by Kate).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_parse.c: CONFIG_NSH_DISABLE_WGET not CONFIG_NSH_DISABLE_GET
	  in one location (found by Kate).
	* apps/examples/ostest/prioinherit.c:  Limit the number of test
	  threads to no more than 3 of each priority.  Bad things happen
	  when the existing logic tried to created several hundred test
	  treads!
	* apps/nshlib/nsh.h:  Both CONFIG_LIBC_STRERROR and CONFIG_NSH_STRERROR
	  must be defined to use strerror() with NSH.
	* apps/examples/*/*_main.c, system/i2c/i2c_main.c, and others:  Added
	  configuration variable CONFIG_USER_ENTRYPOINT that may be used to change
	  the default entry from user_start to some other symbol.  Contributed by
	  Kate.
	* apps/netutils/webserver/httpd/c:  Fix a typo that as introduced in
	  version r4402:  'lese' instead of 'else' (Noted by Max Holtzberg).
	* tools/mkfsdata.pl: The uIP web server CGI image making perl script was
	  moved from apps/netutils/webserver/makefsdata to nuttx/tools/mkfsdata.pl
	  (Part of a larger change submitted by Max Holtzberg).
	* apps/netutils/webserver, apps/examples/uip, and apps/include/netutils/httpd.h:
	  The "canned" version of the uIP web servers content that was at 
	  netutils/webserver/httpd_fsdata.c has been replaced with a dynamically
	  built configuration located at apps/examples/uip (Contributed by
	  Max Holtzberg).
	* apps/netutils/webserver:  Several inenhancements from Kate including the
	  ability to elide scripting and SERVER headers and the ability to map
	  files into memory before transferring them.
	* apps/netutils/webserver:  Add ability to map a URL to CGI function.
	  Contributed by Kate.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_mntcmds.c: The changes of 6.21 introduced holes in the
	  error handling:  Now the number of arguments to mount can be 0 or 4.
	  Additional parameter checking is required to prevent mysterious errors
	  (submiteed by Kate).
	* apps/netutils/webserver/httpd_mmap.c:  Fix errors when the mmap()
	  length is zero (submitted by Kate).
	* apps/netutils/webserver/httpd_sendfile.c:  Add and option,
	  CONFIG_NETUTILS_HTTPD_SENDFILE to transfer files using the NuttX
	  sendfile() interface.
	* apps/netutils/discover:  A UDP network discovery utility contributed
	  by Max Holtzberg.
	* apps/examples/discover:  A test example for the UDP network discovery
	  utility (also contribed by Max Holtzberg).
	* apps/examples/*/main.c:  Too many files called main.c.  Each renamed
	  to something unique so that they will not collide in the archive.
	* apps/netutils/xmlrpc: The Embeddable Lightweight XML-RPC Server
	  discussed at http://www.drdobbs.com/web-development/\
	  an-embeddable-lightweight-xml-rpc-server/184405364.  Contributed by
	  Max Holtzberg.
	* apps/netutils/uip_listenon.c:  Logic in uip_server.c that creates
	  the listening socket was moved to this new file to support re-use.
	  Contributed by Kate.
	* apps/netutils/webserver/httpd.c:  The option CONFIG_NETUTILS_HTTPD_SINGLECONNECT
	  can now be used to limit the server to a single thread.  Option
	  CONFIG_NETUTILS_HTTPD_TIMEOUT can be used to generate HTTP 408 errors.
	  Both from Kate.
	* apps/netutils/webserver/httpd.c:  Improvements to HTTP parser from
	  Kate.
	* apps/netutils/webserver/httpd.c:  Add support for Keep-alive connections
	  (from Kate).
	* apps/NxWidget/Kconfig:  This is a kludge.  I created this NxWidgets
	  directory that ONLY contains Kconfig.  NxWidgets does not live in
	  either the nuttx/ or the apps/ source trees.  This kludge makes it
	  possible to configure NxWidgets/NxWM without too much trouble (with
	  the tradeoff being a kind ugly structure and some maintenance issues).
	* apps/examples/Make.defs: Missing support for apps/examples/watchdog.
	* apps/NxWidgets/Kconfig:  Add option to turn on the memory monitor
	  feature of the NxWidgets/NxWM unit tests.

6.23 2012-11-05 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* vsn: Moved all NSH commands from vsn/ to system/.  Deleted the vsn/
	  directory.
	* Makefile:  Change order of includes when CONFIG_NEWCONFIG=y.  In
	  that case, namedapp must be included first so that the namedapp
	  context is established first.  If the namedapp context is established
	  later, it will overwrite any existing namedapp_list.h and nameapp_proto.h
	  files.
	* CONFIG_EXAMPLES_*: To make things consistent, changed all occurrences
	  of CONFIG_EXAMPLE_* to CONFIG_EXAMPLES_*.
	* Kconfig:  Fleshed out apps/examples/adc/Kconfig and apps/examples/wget/Kconfig.
	  There are still a LOT of empty, stub Kconfig files.
	* Kconfig:  Fleshed out apps/examples/buttons/Kconfig. There are still a LOT
	  of empty, stub Kconfig files.
	* apps/netutils/webserver/httpd.c:  Fix a bug that I introduced in
	  recent check-ins (Darcy Gong).
	* apps/netutils/webclient/webclient.c:  Fix another but that I introduced
	  when I was trying to add correct handling for loss of connection (Darcy Gong)
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_telnetd.c:  Add support for login to Telnet session via
	  username and password (Darcy Gong).
	* apps/netutils/resolv/resolv.c (and files using the DNS resolver): Various
	  DNS address resolution improvements from Darcy Gong.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_netcmds.c:  The ping command now passes a maximum round
	  trip time to uip_icmpping().  This allows pinging of hosts on complex
	  networks where the ICMP ECHO round trip time may exceed the ping interval.
	* apps/examples/nxtext/nxtext_main.c:  Fix bad conditional compilation
	  when CONFIG_NX_KBD is not defined.  Submitted by Petteri Aimonen.
	* apps/examples/nximage/nximage_main.c:  Add a 5 second delay after the
	  NX logo is presented so that there is time for the image to be verified.
	  Suggested by Petteri Aimonen.
	* apps/Makefile: Small change that reduces the number of shell invocations
	  by one (Mike Smith).
	* apps/examples/elf:  Test example for the ELF loader.
	* apps/examples/elf:  The ELF module test example appears fully functional.
	* apps/netutils/json:  Add a snapshot of the cJSON project.  Contributed by
	  Darcy Gong.
	* apps/examples/json:  Test example for cJSON from Darcy Gong
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_netinit.c: Fix static IP DNS problem (Darcy Gong)
	* apps/netutils/resolv/resolv.c: DNS fixes from Darcy Gong.
	* COPYING: Licensing information added.
	* apps/netutils/codec and include/netutils/urldecode.h, base64.h, and md5.h:
	  A port of the BASE46, MD5 and URL CODEC library from Darcy Gong.
	* nsnlib/nsh_codeccmd.c:  NSH commands to use the CODEC library.
	  Contributed by Darcy Gong.
	* apps/examples/wgetjson: Test example contributed by Darcy Gong
	* apps/examples/cxxtest:  A test for the uClibc++ library provided by
	  Qiang Yu and the RGMP team.
	* apps/netutils/webclient, apps/netutils.codes, and apps/examples/wgetjson:
	  Add support for wget POST interface.  Contributed by Darcy Gong.
	* apps/examples/relays:  A relay example contributed by Darcy Gong.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_netcmds: Add ifup and ifdown commands (from Darcy
	  Gong).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_netcmds: Extend the ifconfig command so that it
	  supports setting IP addresses, network masks, name server addresses,
	  and hardware address (from Darcy Gong).

6.24 2012-12-20 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/ostest/roundrobin.c:  Replace large tables with
	  algorithmic prime number generation.  This allows the roundrobin
	  test to run on platforms with minimal SRAM (Freddie Chopin).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_dbgcmds.c:  Add hexdump command to dump the contents
	  of a file (or character device) to the console  Contributed by Petteri
	  Aimonen.
	* apps/examples/modbus:  Fixes from Freddie Chopin
	* apps/examples/modbus/Kconfig: Kconfig logic for FreeModBus contributed
	  by Freddie Chopin.
	* Makefile, */Makefile:  Various fixes for Windows native build.  Now uses
	  make foreach loops instead of shell loops.
	* apps/examples/elf/test/*/Makefile: OSX doesn't support install -D, use
	  mkdir -p then install without the -D.  From Mike Smith.
	* apps/examples/relays/Makefile: Reduced stack requirement (Darcy Gong).
	* apps/nshlib and apps/netutils/dhcpc:  Extend the NSH ifconfig command plus
	  various DHCPC improvements(Darcy Gong).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_apps.c: Fix compilation errors when CONFIG_NSH_DISABLEBG=y.
	  From Freddie Chopin.
	* Rename CONFIG_PCODE and CONFIG_FICL as CONFIG_INTERPRETERS_PCODE and
	  CONFIG_INTERPRETERS_FICL for consistency with other configuration naming.
	* apps/examples/keypadtest:  A keypad test example contributed by Denis
	  Carikli.
	* apps/examples/elf and nxflat:  If CONFIG_BINFMT_EXEPATH is defined, these
	  tests will now use a relative path to the program and expect the binfmt/
	  logic to find the absolute path to the program using the PATH variable.

6.25 2013-xx-xx Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* Makefiles: Removed dependency of distclean on clean in most top-level
	  files.  It makes sense for 'leaf' Makefiles to have this dependency,
	  but it does not make sense for upper-level Makefiles.
	* apps/namedapp/: Renamed to builtins in preparation for another change.
	* .context:  Removed the .context kludge.  This caused lots of problems
	  when changing configurations because there is no easy way to get the
	  system to rebuild the context.  Now, the context will be rebuilt
	  whenever there is a change in either .config or the Makefile.
	* apps/builtin/registry:  Updated new built-in registration logic to handle
	  cases where (1) old apps/.config is used, and (2) applications ared
	  removed, not just added.
	* apps/examples/nettest/Makefile:  Fix an error that crept in during
	  some of the recent, massive build system changes.
	* apps/builtin/Makefile:  Need to have auto-generated header files
	  in place early in the dependency generation phase to avoid warnings.
	  It is not important if they are only stubbed out header files at
	  this build phase.
	* apps/examples/hidbkd: Now supports decoding of encoded special keys
	  if CONFIG_EXAMPLES_HIDKBD_ENCODED is defined.
	* apps/examples/hidbkd:  Add support for decoding key release events
	  as well.  However, the USB HID keyboard drier has not yet been
	  updated to detect key release events.  That is kind of tricky in
	  the USB HID keyboard report data.
	* apps/examples/wlan: Remove non-functional example.
	* apps/examples/ostest/vfork.c:  Added a test of vfork().
	* apps/exampes/posix_spawn: Added a test of poxis_spawn().
	* apps/examples/ostest:  Extend signal handler test to catch
	  death-of-child signals (SIGCHLD).
	* apps/examples/ostest/waitpid.c:  Add a test for waitpid(), waitid(),
	  and wait().
	* builtin/binfs.c:  Add hooks for dup() method (not implemented).
	* builtin/exec_builtin.c, nshlib/nsh_parse.c, and nshlib/nsh_builtin.c:
	  NSH now supports re-direction of I/O to files (but still not from).
	* builtin/binfs.c:  Greatly simplified (it is going to need to be
	  very lightweight).  Now supports open, close, and a new ioctl to recover
	  the builtin filename.  The latter will be needed to support a binfs
	  binfmt.
	* builtin/binfs.c:  Move apps/builtin/binfs.c to fs/binfs/fs_binfs.c
	  CONFIG_APPS_BINDIR rename CONFIG_FS_BINFS
	* apps/include/builtin.h:  Some of the content of
	  apps/include/apps.h moved to include/nuttx/binfmt/builtin.h.
	  apps/include/apps.h renamed builtin.h
	* apps/builtin/exec_builtins.c:  Move utility builtin
	  utility functions from apps/builtin/exec_builtins.c to
	  binfmt/libbuiltin/libbuiltin_utils.c
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_mountcmds.c:  The block driver/source
	  argument is now optional.  Many files systems do not need
	  a source and it is really stupid to have to enter a bogus
	  source parameter.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_fileapp.c:  Add the ability to execute a file
	  from a file system using posix_spawn().
	* apps/builtin/: Extensions from Mike Smith.
	* apps/examples/ftpd/Makefile: Name ftpd_start is not the name of
	  the entrypoint.  Should be ftpd_main (from Yan T.)
	* apps/netutils/telnetd/telnetd_driver: Was stuck in a loop if
	  recv[from]() ever returned a value <= 0.
