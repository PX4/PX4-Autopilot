config NSH_FILEIOSIZE
	int "NSH I/O buffer size"
	default 1024
	---help---
		Size of a static I/O buffer used for file access (ignored if
		there is no filesystem). Default is 1024.

config NSH_STRERROR
	bool "Use strerror()"
	default n
	---help---
		strerror(errno) makes more readable output but strerror() is
		very large and will not be used unless this setting is 'y'

config NSH_LINELEN
	int "Max command line length"
	default 80
	---help---
		The maximum length of one command line and of one output line.
		Default: 80

config NSH_NESTDEPTH
	int "Maximum command nesting"
	default 3
	---help---
		The maximum number of nested if-then[-else]-fi sequences that
		are permissable.  Default: 3

config NSH_DISABLESCRIPT
	bool "Disable script support"
	default n
	---help---
		This can be set to 'y' to suppress support for scripting.  This
		setting disables the 'sh', 'test', and '[' commands and the
		if-then[-else]-fi construct.  This would only be set on systems
		where a minimal footprint is a necessity and scripting is not.

config NSH_DISABLEBG
	bool "Disable background commands"
	default n
	---help---
		This can be set to 'y' to suppress support for background
		commands.  This setting disables the 'nice' command prefix and
		the '&' command suffix.  This would only be set on systems
		where a minimal footprint is a necessity and background command
		execution is not.

config NSH_MMCSDMINOR
	int "MMC/SD minor device number"
	default 0
	---help---
		If the architecture supports an MMC/SD slot and if the NSH
		architecture specific logic is present, this option will provide
		the MMC/SD minor number, i.e., the MMC/SD block driver will
		be registered as /dev/mmcsdN where N is the minor number.
		Default is zero.

config NSH_ROMFSETC
	bool "Support ROMFS start-up script"
	default n
	---help---
		Mount a ROMFS filesystem at /etc and provide a startup script
		at /etc/init.d/rcS.  The default startup script will mount
		a FAT FS RAMDISK at /tmp but the logic is easily extensible.

endif

if NSH_ROMFSETC
config NSH_ROMFSMOUNTPT
	string "ROMFS mount point"
	default "/etc"
	---help---
		The default mountpoint for the ROMFS volume is /etc, but that
		can be changed with this setting.  This must be a absolute path
		beginning with '/'.

config NSH_INITSCRIPT
	string "Relative path to startup script"
	default "init.d/rcS"
	---help---
		This is the relative path to the startup script within the mountpoint.
		The default is init.d/rcS.  This is a relative path and must not
		start with '/'.

config NSH_ROMFSDEVNO
	int "ROMFS block device minor number"
	default 0
	---help---
		This is the minor number of the ROMFS block device.  The default is 
		'0' corresponding to /dev/ram0.

config NSH_ROMFSSECTSIZE
	int "ROMFS sector size"
	default 64
	---help---
		This is the sector size to use with the ROMFS volume.  Since the
		default volume is very small, this defaults to 64 but should be
		increased if the ROMFS volume were to be become large.  Any value
		selected must be a power of 2.

config NSH_FATDEVNO
	int "FAT block device minor number"
	default 0
	---help---
		When the default rcS file used when NSH_ROMFSETC is selected, it
		will mount a FAT FS under /tmp. This is the minor number of the FAT
		FS block device.  The default is '1' corresponding to /dev/ram1.

config NSH_FATSECTSIZE
	int "FAT sector size"
	default 512
	---help---
		When the default rcS file used when NSH_ROMFSETC is selected, it
		will mount a FAT FS under /tmp. This is the sector size use with the
		FAT FS. Default is 512.

config NSH_FATNSECTORS
	int "FAT number of sectors"
	default 1024
	---help---
		When the default rcS file used when NSH_ROMFSETC is selected, it
		will mount a FAT FS under /tmp. This is the number of sectors to use
		with the FAT FS.  Defualt is 1024.  The amount of memory used by the
		FAT FS will be NSH_FATSECTSIZE * NSH_FATNSECTORS bytes.

config NSH_FATMOUNTPT
	string "FAT mount point"
	default 512
	---help---
		When the default rcS file used when NSH_ROMFSETC is selected, it
		will mount a FAT FS under /tmp. This is the location where the FAT
		FS will be mounted.  Default is /tmp.

if NSH_LIBRARY
config NSH_CONSOLE
	bool "Use console"
	default y
	---help---
		If NSH_CONSOLE is set to 'y', then a character driver
		console front-end is selected (/dev/console).

		Normally, the serial console device is a UART and RS-232
		interface.  However, if CONFIG_USBDEV is defined, then a USB
		serial device may, instead, be used if the one of
		the following are defined:

		CONFIG_PL2303 and CONFIG_PL2303_CONSOLE - Sets up the
		Prolifics PL2303 emulation as a console device at /dev/console.

		CONFIG_CDCACM and CONFIG_CDCACM_CONSOLE - Sets up the
		CDC/ACM serial device as a console device at dev/console.

config NSH_CONDEV
	bool "Default console device"
	default "/dev/console"
	depends on NSH_CONSOLE
	---help---
		If NSH_CONSOLE is set to 'y', then NSH_CONDEV
		may also be set to select the serial device used to support
		the NSH console.   This should be set to the quoted name of a
		readable/write-able character driver such as:
		NSH_CONDEV="/dev/ttyS1". This is useful, for example,
		to separate the NSH command line from the system console when
		the system console is used to provide debug output.  Default:
		stdin and stdout (probably "/dev/console")

		NOTE: When any other device other than /dev/console is used
		for a user interface, (1) linefeeds (\n) will not be expanded to
		carriage return / linefeeds (\r\n).  You will need to set
		your terminal program to account for this.  And (2) input is
		not automatically echoed so you will have to turn local echo on.

config NSH_ARCHINIT
	bool "Have architecture-specific initialization"
	default n
	---help---
		Set if your board provides architecture specific initialization
		via the board-specific function nsh_archinitialize().  This
		function will be called early in NSH initialization to allow
		board logic to do such things as configure MMC/SD slots.

config NSH_TELNET
	bool "Use Telnet console"
	default n
	depends on NET && NET_TCP
	---help---
		If NSH_TELNET is set to 'y', then a TELENET
		server front-end is selected.  When this option is provided,
		you may log into NuttX remotely using telnet in order to
		access NSH.

endif

if NSH_TELNET
config NSH_TELNETD_PORT
	int "Telnet port number"
	default 23
	---help---
		The telnet daemon will listen on this TCP port number for connections.
		Default: 23

config NSH_TELNETD_DAEMONPRIO
	int "Telnet daemon priority"
	default 100
	---help---
		Priority of the Telnet daemon. Default: 100

config NSH_TELNETD_DAEMONSTACKSIZE
	int "Telnet daemon stack size"
	default 2048
	---help---
		Stack size allocated for the Telnet daemon. Default: 2048

config NSH_TELNETD_CLIENTPRIO
	int "Telnet client priority"
	default 100
	---help---
		Priority of the Telnet client. Default: 100

config NSH_TELNETD_CLIENTSTACKSIZE
	int "Telnet client stack size"
	default 2048
	---help---
		Stack size allocated for the Telnet client. Default: 2048

config NSH_IOBUFFER_SIZE
	int "Telnet I/O buffer size"
	default 512
	---help---
		Determines the size of the I/O buffer to use for sending/
		receiving TELNET commands/reponses.  Default: 512
endif

config NSH_DHCPC
	bool "Use DHCP to get IP address"
	default n
	depends on NSH_LIBRARY && NET && NET_UDP && NET_BROADCAST
	---help---
		Obtain the IP address via DHCP.

		Per RFC2131 (p. 9), the DHCP client must be prepared to receive DHCP
		messages of up to 576 bytes (excluding Ethernet, IP, or UDP headers and FCS).

config NSH_IPADDR
	hex "Target IP address"
	default 0x10000002
	depends on NSH_LIBRARY && NET && !NSH_DHCPC
	---help---
		If NSH_DHCPC is NOT set, then the static IP address must be provided.
		This is a 32-bit integer value in host order.  So, as an example,
		0x10000002 would be 10.0.0.2.

config NSH_DRIPADDR
	hex "Router IP address"
	default 0x10000001
	depends on NSH_LIBRARY && NET && !NSH_DHCPC
	---help---
		Default router IP address (aka, Gateway).  This is a 32-bit integer
		value in host order.  So, as an example, 0x10000001 would be 10.0.0.1.

config NSH_NETMASK
	hex "Network mask"
	default 0xffffff00
	depends on NSH_LIBRARY && NET && !NSH_DHCPC
	---help---
		Network mask.  This is a 32-bit integer value in host order.  So, as
		an example, 0xffffff00 would be 255.255.255.0.

config NSH_NOMAC
	bool "Hardware has no MAC address"
	default n
	depends on NSH_LIBRARY && NET
	---help---
		Set if your ethernet hardware has no built-in MAC address.
		If set, a bogus MAC will be assigned.
