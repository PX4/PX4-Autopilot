# mavsdk_tests is a black-box MAVLink integration-test driver that talks to a
# running PX4 over UDP. It does not depend on any specific simulator backend
# (sitl_gazebo-classic, gz, sih, jmavsim, ...) — it just needs a PX4 binary
# to be running. Defined here at the top level rather than under any sitl
# backend file so the dependency graph is honest.
