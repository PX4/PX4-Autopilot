### Description
uORB is the internal pub-sub messaging system, used for communication between modules.

### Implementation
The implementation is asynchronous and lock-free, ie. a publisher does not wait for a subscriber and vice versa.
This is achieved by having a separate buffer between a publisher and a subscriber.

The code is optimized to minimize the memory footprint and the latency to exchange messages.

Messages are defined in the `/msg` directory. They are converted into C/C++ code at build-time.

If compiled with ORB_USE_PUBLISHER_RULES, a file with uORB publication rules can be used to configure which
modules are allowed to publish which topics. This is used for system-wide replay.

### Examples
Monitor topic publication rates. Besides `top`, this is an important command for general system inspection:
$ uorb top
)DESCR_STR");
