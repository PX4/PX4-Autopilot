            The integer refers to the I2C bus number where PCA9685 is connected.

        description:
          short: PWM update rate
          long: |
            Controls the update rate of PWM output.
            Flight Controller will inform those numbers of update events in a second, to PCA9685.
            Higher update rate will consume more I2C bandwidth, which may even lead to worse
            output latency, or completely block I2C bus.

      PCA9685_PWM_FREQ:
        description:
          short: PWM cycle frequency
          long: |
            Controls the PWM frequency at timing perspective.
            This is independent from PWM update frequency, as PCA9685 is capable to output
            without being continuously commanded by FC.
            Higher frequency leads to more accurate pulse width, but some ESCs and servos may not support it.
            This parameter should be set to the same value as PWM update rate in most case.
            This parameter MUST NOT exceed upper limit of 400.0, if any outputs as generic 1000~2000us
            pulse width is desired. Frequency higher than 400 only makes sense in duty-cycle mode.

            The driver will output standard pulse-width encoded signal without this bit set.
            To make PCA9685 output in duty-cycle fashion, please enable the corresponding
            channel bit here and adjusting standard params to suit your need.
            The driver will have 12bits resolution for duty-cycle output. That means to achieve 0% to 100%
            output range on one channel, the corresponding params MIN and MAX for the channel should be set
            to 0 and 4096. Other standard params follows the same rule.
