/**

 *
 * This driver does not use the built-in sensor fusion mcu of this
 * IMU (only fetches the sensor values).
 *
 * TODOs:
 *  - i2c only for now
 *  - read temperature as well
 *  - this module can call usleep, although it uses WorkItem
 *  - the chip has an accel, gyro and mag; all are implemented here, which means that
 *    this doesn't 100% fit in imu/ nor compass/
 *  - this is based on the bmi160 driver, not sure if this is a good thing
 *  - the default BNO055_I2C_ADDR1 will always be used, regardless of input
 *
