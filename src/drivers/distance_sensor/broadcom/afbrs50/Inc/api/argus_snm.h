 * @brief       Shot Noise Monitor (SNM) parameter definitions and API functions.
 *
 * @details     The SNM is an algorithm to monitor and react on shot noise
 *              induced by harsh environment conditions like high ambient
 *              light.
 *
 *              The AFBR-S50 API provides three modes:
 *              - Dynamic: Automatic mode, automatically adopts to current
 *                         ambient conditions.
 *              - Static (Outdoor): Static mode, optimized for outdoor applications.
 *              - Static (Indoor): Static mode, optimized for indoor applications.
 *              .
