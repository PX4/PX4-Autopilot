 * @brief       Dynamic Configuration Adaption (DCA) parameter definitions and API functions.
 *
 * @details     The DCA contains an algorithms that detect ambient conditions
 *              and adopt the device configuration to the changing parameters
 *              dynamically while operating the sensor. This is achieved by
 *              rating the currently received signal quality and changing the
 *              device configuration accordingly to the gathered information
 *              from the current measurement frame results before the next
 *              integration cycle starts.
 *
 *              The DCA consists of the following features:
 *              - Static or Dynamic mode. The first is utilizing the nominal
 *                values while the latter is dynamically adopting between min.
 *                and max. value and starting from the nominal values.
 *              - Analog Integration Depth Adaption (from multiple patterns down to single pulses)
 *              - Optical Output Power Adaption
 *              - Pixel Input Gain Adaption (w/ ambient light rejection)
 *              - ADC Sensitivity (i.e. ADC Range) Adaption
 *              - Power Saving Ratio (to decrease the average output power and thus the current consumption)
 *              - All that features are heeding the Laser Safety limits.
 *              .
