      SEP_YAW_OFFS:
        description:
          short: Heading/Yaw offset for dual antenna GPS
          long: |
            Heading offset angle for dual antenna GPS setups that support heading estimation.

            Set this to 0 if the antennas are parallel to the forward-facing direction
            of the vehicle and the rover antenna is in front.

            The offset angle increases clockwise.

            Set this to 90 if the rover antenna is placed on the
            right side of the vehicle and the moving base antenna is on the left side.

      SEP_SAT_INFO:
        description:
          short: Enable sat info
          long: |
            Enable publication of satellite info (ORB_ID(satellite_info)) if possible.
        type: boolean
        default: 0
        reboot_required: true
      SEP_PITCH_OFFS:
        description:
          short: Pitch offset for dual antenna GPS
          long: |
            Vertical offsets can be compensated for by adjusting the Pitch offset.

            Note that this can be interpreted as the "roll" angle in case the antennas are aligned along the perpendicular axis.
            This occurs in situations where the two antenna ARPs may not be exactly at the same height in the vehicle reference frame.
            Since pitch is defined as the right-handed rotation about the vehicle Y axis,
            a situation where the main antenna is mounted lower than the aux antenna (assuming the default antenna setup) will result in a positive pitch.
        type: float
        decimal: 3
        default: 0
        min: -90

      SEP_DUMP_COMM:
        description:
          short: Log GPS communication data
          long: |
            If this is set to 1, all GPS communication data will be published via uORB,
            and written to the log file as gps_dump message.

            If this is set to 2, the main GPS is configured to output RTCM data,
            which is then logged as gps_dump and can be used for PPK.
        type: enum
        default: 0
        min: 0
        max: 2
        values:
          0: Disable
          1: Full communication
          2: RTCM output (PPK)
      SEP_LOG_HZ:
        description:
          short: Logging frequency for the receiver
          long: |
            Select the frequency at which the connected receiver should log data.
        type: float
        default: 1

      SEP_LOG_LEVEL:
        description:
          short: Logging level for the receiver
          long: |
            Select the level of detail that needs to be logged by the receiver.
        type: enum
        default: 2
        min: 0
        max: 3
        values:
          0: Lite

          3: Full
        reboot_required: true
      SEP_LOG_FORCE:
        description:
          short: Whether to overwrite or add to existing logging
          long: |
            When the receiver is already set up to log data, this decides whether extra logged data should be added or overwrite existing data.
        type: boolean
        default: false
