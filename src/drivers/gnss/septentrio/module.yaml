      SEP_YAW_OFFS:
        description:
          short: Heading/Yaw offset for dual antenna GPS
          long: |
            Heading offset angle for dual antenna GPS setups that support heading estimation.

            Set this to 0 if the antennas are parallel to the forward-facing direction
            of the vehicle and the rover antenna is in front.

            The offset angle increases clockwise.

            Set this to 90 if the rover antenna is placed on the
            right side of the vehicle and the moving base antenna is on the left side.

        type: boolean
        default: 0
        reboot_required: true
      SEP_PITCH_OFFS:
        description:
          short: Pitch offset for dual antenna GPS
          long: |
            Vertical offsets can be compensated for by adjusting the Pitch offset.

            Note that this can be interpreted as the "roll" angle in case the antennas are aligned along the perpendicular axis.
            This occurs in situations where the two antenna ARPs may not be exactly at the same height in the vehicle reference frame.
            Since pitch is defined as the right-handed rotation about the vehicle Y axis,
            a situation where the main antenna is mounted lower than the aux antenna (assuming the default antenna setup) will result in a positive pitch.
        type: float
        decimal: 3

          long: |
            Log raw communication between the driver and connected receivers.
            For example, "To receiver" will log all commands and corrections sent by the driver to the receiver.

      SEP_AUTO_CONFIG:
        description:
          short: Toggle automatic receiver configuration
          long: |
            By default, the receiver is automatically configured. Sometimes it may be used for multiple purposes.
            If the offered parameters aren't sufficient, this parameter can be disabled to have full control of the receiver configuration.
            A good way to use this is to enable automatic configuration, let the receiver be configured, and then disable it to make manual adjustments.

      SEP_CONST_USAGE:
