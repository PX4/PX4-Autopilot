- group: SD Logging
  definitions:
    SDLOG_ALGORITHM:
      description:
        short: Logfile Encryption algorithm
        long: Selects the algorithm used for logfile encryption
      type: enum
      values:
        0: Disabled
        2: XChaCha20
      default: 2
    SDLOG_KEY:
      description:
        short: Logfile Encryption key index
        long: Selects the key in keystore, used for encrypting the log. When using
          a symmetric encryption algorithm, the key is generated at logging start
          and kept stored in this index. For symmetric algorithms, the key is volatile
          and valid only for the duration of logging. The key is stored in encrypted
          format on the sdcard alongside the logfile, using an RSA2048 key defined
          by the SDLOG_EXCHANGE_KEY
      type: int32
      default: 2
      min: 0
      max: 255
    SDLOG_EXCH_KEY:
      description:
        short: Logfile Encryption key exchange key
        long: If the logfile is encrypted using a symmetric key algorithm, the used
          encryption key is generated at logging start and stored on the sdcard RSA2048
          encrypted using this key.
      type: int32
      default: 1
      min: 0
      max: 255
