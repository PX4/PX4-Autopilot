    SDLOG_UTC_OFFSET:
      description:
        short: 'UTC offset (unit: min)'
        long: the difference in hours and minutes from Coordinated Universal Time
          (UTC) for a your place and date. for example, In case of South Korea(UTC+09:00),
          UTC offset is 540 min (9*60) refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UTC_time_offsets
      type: int32
      default: 0
      unit: min
      min: -1000
      max: 1000
    SDLOG_MODE:
      description:
        short: Logging Mode
        long: 'Determines when to start and stop logging. By default, logging is started
          when arming the system, and stopped when disarming. Note: The logging start/end
          points that can be configured here only apply to SD logging. The mavlink
          backend is started/stopped independently of these points.'
      type: enum
      values:
        0: when armed until disarm (default)
        1: from boot until disarm
        2: from boot until shutdown
        3: while manual input AUX1 >30%
        4: from 1st armed until shutdown
      default: 0
      reboot_required: true
    SDLOG_BACKEND:
      description:
        short: Logging Backend (integer bitmask)
        long: 'If no logging is set the logger will not be started. Set bits true
          to enable: 0: SD card logging 1: Mavlink logging'
      type: bitmask
      bit:
        0: SD card logging
        1: Mavlink logging
      default: 3
      min: 0
      max: 3
      reboot_required: true
    SDLOG_BOOT_BAT:
      description:
        short: Battery-only Logging
        long: When enabled, logging will not start from boot if battery power is not
          detected (e.g. powered via USB on a test bench). This prevents extraneous
          flight logs from being created during bench testing. Note that this only
          applies to log-from-boot modes. This has no effect on arm-based modes.
      type: boolean
      default: 0
    SDLOG_MISSION:
      description:
        short: Mission Log
        long: If enabled, a small additional "mission" log file will be written to
          the SD card. The log contains just those messages that are useful for tasks
          like generating flight statistics and geotagging. The different modes can
          be used to further reduce the logged data (and thus the log file size).
          For example, choose geotagging mode to only log data required for geotagging.
          Note that the normal/full log is still created, and contains all the data
          in the mission log (and more).
      type: enum
      values:
        0: Disabled
        1: All mission messages
        2: Geotagging messages
      default: 0
      reboot_required: true
    SDLOG_PROFILE:
      description:
        short: Logging topic profile (integer bitmask)
        long: 'This integer bitmask controls the set and rates of logged topics. The
          default allows for general log analysis while keeping the log file size
          reasonably small. Enabling multiple sets leads to higher bandwidth requirements
          and larger log files. Set bits true to enable: 0 : Default set (used for
          general log analysis) 1 : Full rate estimator (EKF2) replay topics 2 : Topics
          for thermal calibration (high rate raw IMU and Baro sensor data) 3 : Topics
          for system identification (high rate actuator control and IMU data) 4 :
          Full rates for analysis of fast maneuvers (RC, attitude, rates and actuators)
          5 : Debugging topics (debug_*.msg topics, for custom code) 6 : Topics for
          sensor comparison (low rate raw IMU, Baro and magnetometer data) 7 : Topics
          for computer vision and collision prevention 8 : Raw FIFO high-rate IMU
          (Gyro) 9 : Raw FIFO high-rate IMU (Accel) 10: Logging of mavlink tunnel
          message (useful for payload communication debugging)'
      type: bitmask
      bit:
        0: Default set (general log analysis)
        1: Estimator replay (EKF2)
        2: Thermal calibration
        3: System identification
        4: High rate
        5: Debug
        6: Sensor comparison
        7: Computer Vision and Avoidance
        8: Raw FIFO high-rate IMU (Gyro)
        9: Raw FIFO high-rate IMU (Accel)
        10: Mavlink tunnel message logging
        11: High rate sensors
      default: 1

      reboot_required: true
    SDLOG_DIRS_MAX:
      description:
        short: Maximum number of log directories to keep
        long: 'If there are more log directories than this value, the system will
          delete the oldest directories during startup. In addition, the system will
          delete old logs if there is not enough free space left. The minimum amount
          is 300 MB. If this is set to 0, old directories will only be removed if
          the free space falls below the minimum. Note: this does not apply to mission
          log files.'

    SDLOG_UUID:
      description:
        short: Log UUID
        long: If set to 1, add an ID to the log, which uniquely identifies the vehicle
      type: boolean
      default: 1
