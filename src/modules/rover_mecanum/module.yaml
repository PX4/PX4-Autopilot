          short: Wheel track
          long: Distance from the center of the right wheels to the center of the left wheels.
        type: float
        unit: m
        min: 0.001
        max: 100
        increment: 0.001
        decimal: 3
        default: 0.5

      RM_MAX_YAW_RATE:
        description:
          short: Maximum allowed yaw rate for the rover.
          long: |
            This parameter is used to cap desired yaw rates and map controller inputs to desired yaw rates in acro mode.
        type: float
        unit: deg/s
        min: 0.01
        max: 1000
        increment: 0.01
        decimal: 2
        default: 90

      RM_MAX_THR_YAW_R:
        description:
          short: Yaw rate turning left/right wheels at max speed in opposite directions
          long: |
            This parameter is used to calculate the feedforward term of the closed loop yaw rate control.
            The controller first calculates the required speed difference between the left and right motor to achieve the desired yaw rate.
            This desired speed difference is then linearly mapped to normalized motor commands.
            A good starting point is twice the speed the rover drives at maximum throttle (RM_MAX_THRTL_SPD)).
            Increase this parameter if the rover turns faster than the setpoint, and decrease if the rover turns slower.

          long: |
            This parameter is used cap the maximum speed the rover is allowed to drive
            and to map stick inputs to desired speeds in position mode.
        type: float
        unit: m/s
        min: 0
        max: 100

      RM_MAX_THR_SPD:
        description:
          short: Speed the rover drives at maximum throttle
          long: |
            This parameter is used to calculate the feedforward term of the closed loop speed control which linearly
            maps desired speeds to normalized motor commands [-1. 1].
            A good starting point is the observed ground speed when the rover drives at maximum throttle in manual mode.
            Increase this parameter if the rover is faster than the setpoint, and decrease if the rover is slower.

          long: |
            The waypoint transition speed is calculated as:
            Transition_speed = Maximum_speed * (1 - normalized_transition_angle * RM_MISS_VEL_GAIN)
            The normalized transition angle is the angle between the line segment from prev-curr WP and curr-next WP
            interpolated from [0, 180] -> [0, 1].
            Higher value -> More velocity reduction during cornering.
