        description:
          short: Threshold to update course control in manual position mode
          long: |
            Threshold for the angle between the active cruise direction and the cruise direction given
            by the stick inputs.
            This can be understood as a deadzone for the combined stick inputs for forward/backwards
            and lateral speed which defines a course direction.

            long: Assign value <1.0 to decrease stick response for yaw control.
