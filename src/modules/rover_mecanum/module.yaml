      RM_WHEEL_TRACK:
          description:
            short: Wheel track
            long: Distance from the center of the right wheel to the center of the left wheel.
          type: float
          unit: m
          min: 0
          max: 100
          increment: 0.001
          decimal: 3
          default: 0

      RM_MAX_THR_YAW_R:
        description:
          short: Yaw rate turning left/right wheels at max speed in opposite directions
          long: |
            This parameter is used to calculate the feedforward term of the closed loop yaw rate control.
            The controller first calculates the required speed difference between the left and right motor to achieve the desired yaw rate.
            This desired speed difference is then linearly mapped to normalized motor commands.
            A good starting point is half the speed the rover drives at maximum throttle (RD_MAX_THR_SPD)).
            Increase this parameter if the rover turns faster than the setpoint, and decrease if the rover turns slower.
        type: float
        unit: m/s
        min: 0
        max: 100
        increment: 0.01
        decimal: 2
        default: 0

      RM_MISS_SPD_GAIN:
        description:
          short: Tuning parameter for the speed reduction during waypoint transition
          long: |
            The waypoint transition speed is calculated as:
            Transition_speed = Maximum_speed * (1 - normalized_transition_angle * RM_MISS_VEL_GAIN)
            The normalized transition angle is the angle between the line segment from prev-curr waypoint and
            curr-next waypoint interpolated from [0, 180] -> [0, 1].
            Higher value -> More speed reduction during waypoint transitions.
            Set to -1 to disable any speed reduction during waypoint transition.
        type: float
        min: -1
        max: 100
        increment: 0.01
        decimal: 2
        default: -1

      RM_COURSE_CTL_TH:
        description:
          short: Threshold to update course control in manual position mode
          long: |
            Threshold for the angle between the active cruise direction and the cruise direction given
            by the stick inputs.
            This can be understood as a deadzone for the combined stick inputs for forward/backwards
            and lateral speed which defines a course direction.
        type: float
        unit: rad
        min: 0
        max: 3.14
        increment: 0.01
        decimal: 2
        default: 0.17
