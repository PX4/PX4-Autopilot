  definitions:
    EKF2_TERR_NOISE:
      description:
        short: Terrain altitude process noise
      type: float
      default: 5.0
      min: 0.5
      unit: m/s
      decimal: 1
    EKF2_TERR_GRAD:
      description:
        short: Magnitude of terrain gradient
      type: float
      default: 0.5
      min: 0.0
      unit: m/m
      decimal: 2
    EKF2_MIN_RNG:
      description:
        short: Expected range finder reading when on ground
        long: If the vehicle is on ground, is not moving as determined by the motion
          test and the range finder is returning invalid or no data, then an assumed
          range value of EKF2_MIN_RNG will be used by the terrain estimator so that
          a terrain height estimate is available at the start of flight in situations
          where the range finder may be inside its minimum measurements distance when
          on ground.
      type: float
      default: 0.01
      min: 0.01
      unit: m
      decimal: 2
