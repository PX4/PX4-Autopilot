        BAT${i}_V_DIV:
            description:
                short: Battery ${i} voltage divider (V divider)
                long: |
                    This is the divider from battery ${i} voltage to ADC voltage.
                    If using e.g. Mauch power modules the value from the datasheet
                    can be applied straight here. A value of -1 means to use
                    the board default.

            type: float
            decimal: 8
            reboot_required: true
            num_instances: *max_num_config_instances
            instance_start: 1
            default: [-1.0, -1.0]

        BAT${i}_A_PER_V:
            description:
                short: Battery ${i} current per volt (A/V)
                long: |
                    The voltage seen by the ADC multiplied by this factor
                    will determine the battery current. A value of -1 means to use
                    the board default.

            type: float
            decimal: 8
            reboot_required: true
            num_instances: *max_num_config_instances
            instance_start: 1
            default: [-1.0, -1.0]

        BAT${i}_V_CHANNEL:
            description:
                short: Battery ${i} Voltage ADC Channel
                long: |
                    This parameter specifies the ADC channel used to monitor voltage of main power battery.
                    A value of -1 means to use the board default. A value of -2 disables analog monitoring.
                    This is useful when the FMU supports both analog and digital voltage monitoring and you want
                    to use digital monitoring exclusively.

            reboot_required: true
            num_instances: *max_num_config_instances
            instance_start: 1
            default: [-1, -1]

        BAT${i}_I_CHANNEL:
            description:
                short: Battery ${i} Current ADC Channel
                long: |
                    This parameter specifies the ADC channel used to monitor current of main power battery.
                    A value of -1 means to use the board default.

            type: int32
            reboot_required: true
            num_instances: *max_num_config_instances
            instance_start: 1
            default: [-1, -1]

        BAT${i}_I_OVERWRITE:
            description:
                short: Battery ${i} idle current overwrite
                long: |
                    This parameter allows to overwrite the current measured during
                    idle (unarmed) state with a user-defined constant value (expressed in amperes).
                    When the system is armed, the measured current is used. This is useful
                    because on certain ESCs current measurements are inaccurate in case of no load.
                    Negative values are ignored and will cause the measured current to be used.
                    The default value of 0 disables the overwrite, in which case the measured value
                    is always used.

            decimal: 8
            reboot_required: true
            num_instances: *max_num_config_instances
            instance_start: 1
            default: [0, 0]
