 * Parameters defined by the position control task for unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs)
 *
 * This is a modification of the fixed wing/ground rover params and it is designed for ground rovers.
 * It has been developed starting from the fw  module, simplified and improved with dedicated items.
 *
 * All the ackowledgments and credits for the fw wing/rover app are reported in those files.
