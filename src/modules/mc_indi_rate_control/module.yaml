            description:
                short: Thrust coefficient of rotor ${i}
                long: |
                  The thrust coefficient is defined as Thrust = CT * omega^2,
                  where omega is the angular velocity of the rotor in rad/s.
                  The unit is in metric units (N/(rad/s)^2)

                  The moment coefficient is defined as Torque = Km * Thrust (N)

                  Use a positive value for a rotor with CCW rotation.
                  Use a negative value for a rotor with CW rotation.

                  The unit is in metric units (kg*m^2)

            description:
                short: INDI G1 adaptive constant for rotor ${i}
                long: |
                  G1 matrix adaptive constant for rotor ${i} in the INDI effectiveness matrix adaptation.
                  This constant affects the adaptation rate of the G1 matrix (moment part) for this specific rotor.
                  Larger values result in faster adaptation but can cause instability if too high.

            description:

                long: |
                  G2 matrix adaptive constant for rotor ${i} in the INDI effectiveness matrix adaptation.
                  This constant affects the adaptation rate of the G2 matrix (gyroscopic part) for this specific rotor.
                  Larger values result in faster adaptation but can cause instability if too high.
