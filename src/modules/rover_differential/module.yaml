      RD_WHEEL_TRACK:
          description:
            short: Wheel track
            long: Distance from the center of the right wheel to the center of the left wheel.
          type: float
          unit: m
          min: 0
          max: 100
          increment: 0.001
          decimal: 3
          default: 0

      RD_MAX_THR_YAW_R:
        description:
          short: Yaw rate turning left/right wheels at max speed in opposite directions
          long: |
            This parameter is used to calculate the feedforward term of the closed loop yaw rate control.
            The controller first calculates the required speed difference between the left and right motor to achieve the desired yaw rate.
            This desired speed difference is then linearly mapped to normalized motor commands.
            A good starting point is half the speed the rover drives at maximum throttle (RD_MAX_THR_SPD)).
            Increase this parameter if the rover turns faster than the setpoint, and decrease if the rover turns slower.
        type: float
        unit: m/s
        min: 0
        max: 100
        increment: 0.01
        decimal: 2
        default: 0

      RD_TRANS_TRN_DRV:
        description:
            short: Yaw error threshhold to switch from spot turning to driving
            long: |
              This threshold is used for the state machine to switch from turning to driving based on the
              error between the desired and actual yaw.
        type: float
        unit: rad
        min: 0.001
        max: 3.14159
        increment: 0.01
        decimal: 3
        default: 0.0872665

      RD_TRANS_DRV_TRN:
        description:
            short: Yaw error threshhold to switch from driving to spot turning
            long: |
              This threshold is used for the state machine to switch from driving to turning based on the
              error between the desired and actual yaw. It is also used as the threshold whether the rover should come
              to a smooth stop at the next waypoint. This slow down effect is active if the angle between the
              line segments from prevWP-currWP and currWP-nextWP is smaller then 180 - RD_TRANS_DRV_TRN.
        type: float
        unit: rad
        min: 0.001
        max: 3.14159
        increment: 0.01
        decimal: 3
        default: 0.174533

      RD_MISS_SPD_GAIN:
        description:
          short: Tuning parameter for the speed reduction during waypoint transition
          long: |
            The waypoint transition speed is calculated as:
            Transition_speed = Maximum_speed * (1 - normalized_transition_angle * RM_MISS_VEL_GAIN)
            The normalized transition angle is the angle between the line segment from prev-curr WP and curr-next WP
            interpolated from [0, 180] -> [0, 1].
            Higher value -> More speed reduction during waypoint transitions.
            Set to -1 to disable any speed reduction during waypoint transition.
        type: float
        min: -1
        max: 100
        increment: 0.01
        decimal: 2
        default: -1
