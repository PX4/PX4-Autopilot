      RD_WHEEL_TRACK:
          description:
            short: Wheel track
            long: Distance from the center of the right wheel to the center of the left wheel.
          type: float
          unit: m
          min: 0
          max: 100
          increment: 0.001
          decimal: 3
          default: 0

      RD_TRANS_TRN_DRV:
        description:
            short: Yaw error threshhold to switch from spot turning to driving
            long: |
              This threshold is used for the state machine to switch from turning to driving based on the
              error between the desired and actual yaw.
        type: float
        unit: rad
        min: 0.001
        max: 3.14159
        increment: 0.01
        decimal: 3
        default: 0.0872665

      RD_TRANS_DRV_TRN:
        description:
            short: Yaw error threshhold to switch from driving to spot turning
            long: |
              This threshold is used for the state machine to switch from driving to turning based on the
              error between the desired and actual yaw. It is also used as the threshold whether the rover should come
              to a smooth stop at the next waypoint. This slow down effect is active if the angle between the
              line segments from prevWP-currWP and currWP-nextWP is smaller then 180 - RD_TRANS_DRV_TRN.
        type: float
        unit: rad
        min: 0.001
        max: 3.14159
        increment: 0.01
        decimal: 3
        default: 0.174533

      RD_YAW_STK_GAIN:
        description:
            short: Yaw stick gain for Manual mode
            long: Assign value <1.0 to decrease stick response for yaw control.
        type: float
        min: 0.1
        max: 1
        increment: 0.01
        decimal: 3
