/**
 * Driver for the PX4 audio .
 *
 * The tune_control supports a set of predefined "alarm" tunes and
 * one user-supplied tune.
 *
 * Tunes follow the syntax of the Microsoft GWBasic/QBasic PLAY
 * statement, with some exceptions and extensions.
 *
 * From Wikibooks:
 *
 * PLAY "[string expression]"
 *
 * Used to play notes and a score ... The tones are indicated by letters A through G.
 * Accidentals are indicated with a "+" or "#" (for sharp) or "-" (for flat)
 * immediately after the note letter. See this example:
 *
 *   PLAY "C C# C C#"
 *
 * Whitespaces are ignored inside the string expression. There are also codes that
 * set the duration, octave and tempo. They are all case-insensitive. PLAY executes
 * the commands or notes the order in which they appear in the string. Any indicators
 * that change the properties are effective for the notes following that indicator.
 *
 * Ln     Sets the duration (length) of the notes. The variable n does not indicate an actual duration
 *        amount but rather a note type; L1 - whole note, L2 - half note, L4 - quarter note, etc.
 *        (L8, L16, L32, L64, ...). By default, n = 4.
 *        For triplets and quintets, use L3, L6, L12, ... and L5, L10, L20, ... series respectively.
 *        The shorthand notation of length is also provided for a note. For example, "L4 CDE L8 FG L4 AB"
 *        can be shortened to "L4 CDE F8G8 AB". F and G play as eighth notes while others play as quarter notes.
 * On     Sets the current octave. Valid values for n are 0 through 6. An octave begins with C and ends with B.
 *        Remember that C- is equivalent to B.
 * < >    Changes the current octave respectively down or up one level.
 * Nn     Plays a specified note in the seven-octave range. Valid values are from 0 to 84. (0 is a pause.)
 *        Cannot use with sharp and flat. Cannot use with the shorthand notation neither.
 * MN     Stand for Music Normal. Note duration is 7/8ths of the length indicated by Ln. It is the default mode.
 * ML     Stand for Music Legato. Note duration is full length of that indicated by Ln.
 * MS     Stand for Music Staccato. Note duration is 3/4ths of the length indicated by Ln.
 * Pn     Causes a silence (pause) for the length of note indicated (same as Ln).
 * Tn     Sets the number of "L4"s per minute (tempo). Valid values are from 32 to 255. The default value is T120.
 * .      When placed after a note, it causes the duration of the note to be 3/2 of the set duration.
 *        This is how to get "dotted" notes. "L4 C#." would play C sharp as a dotted quarter note.
 *        It can be used for a pause as well.
 *
 * Extensions/variations:
 *
 * MB MF  The MF command causes the tune to play once and then stop. The MB command causes the
 *        tune to repeat when it ends.
