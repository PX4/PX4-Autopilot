            description:
                short: Empty cell voltage
                long: |
                    Defines the voltage where a single cell of the battery is considered empty.
                    The voltage should be chosen above the steep dropoff at 3.5V. A typical
                    lithium battery can only be discharged under high load down to 10% before
                    it drops off to a voltage level damaging the cells.

                long: |
                    This parameter controls the source of battery data. The value 'Power Module'
                    means that measurements are expected to come from a power module. If the value is set to
                    'External' then the system expects to receive mavlink battery status messages.
                    If the value is set to 'ESCs', the battery information are taken from the esc_status message.
                    This requires the ESC to provide both voltage as well as current.
            type: enum
            values:
                -1: Disabled

                    Sets the threshold when the battery will be reported as low.
                    This has to be higher than the critical threshold.

            description:
                short: Critical threshold.
                long: |
                    Sets the threshold when the battery will be reported as critically low.
                    This has to be lower than the low threshold. This threshold commonly
                    will trigger RTL.

            description:
                short: Emergency threshold.
                long: |
                    Sets the threshold when the battery will be reported as dangerously low.
                    This has to be lower than the critical threshold. This threshold commonly
                    will trigger landing.

                long: |
                    This value is used to initialize the in-flight average current estimation,
                    which in turn is used for estimating remaining flight time and RTL triggering.

            unit: A

                long: |
                    If true, receiving a mavlink battery_status message can set
                    the battery state to disconnected if all the voltages are UINT16_MAX - 1.
