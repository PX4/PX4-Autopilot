 * Multicopter air-mode
 *
 * The air-mode enables the mixer to increase the total thrust of the multirotor
 * in order to keep attitude and rate control even at low and high throttle.
 *
 * This function should be disabled during tuning as it will help the controller
 * to diverge if the closed-loop is unstable (i.e. the vehicle is not tuned yet).
 *
 * Enabling air-mode for yaw requires the use of an arming switch.
