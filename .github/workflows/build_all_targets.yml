# NOTE: this workflow is now running on Dronecode / PX4 AWS account.
# - If you want to keep the tests running in GitHub Actions you need to uncomment the "runs-on: ubuntu-latest" lines
#   and comment the "runs-on: [runs-on,runner=..." lines.
# - If you would like to duplicate this setup try setting up "RunsOn" on your own AWS account try https://runs-on.com
