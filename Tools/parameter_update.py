File: parameter_update.py
Description:
    This script searches for declarations of BlockParam, creates a variable name of the
    form "_param_name_of_parameter" and replaces the old variable with the new one.

Example:
        (ParamExtFloat<px4::params::EKF2_GYR_NOISE>) _gyroNoise,
        [...]
        _gyroNoise.set(1.f);

    is replaced by

        (ParamExtFloat<px4::params::EKF2_GYR_NOISE>) _param_ekf2_gyr_noise,
        [...]
        _param_ekf2_gyr_noise.set(1.f);

Usage:
    The script needs a list of files as an input. To quickly find and feed all the file
    that it needs to inspect, one can simply pipe the result of a ripgrep -l command as follows:

        rg -l '\.[gs]et\(|px4::params::' -tcpp | python3 parameter_update.py
