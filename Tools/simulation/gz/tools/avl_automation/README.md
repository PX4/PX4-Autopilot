## Purpose

The idea of this tool is to automate the writing of the Advanced Lift Drag plugin by automatizing the coefficient generation and requiring minimal user calculations.

## Functionality

The tool first asks the user for a range of vehicle specific parameters that are needed in order to specify the geometry and physical properties of the plane. The user has the choice to define a completely custom model, or alternatively select a predefined model template (such as a Cessna or a VTOL), which has a known number of control surfaces, and then provide only some physical properties, without having to define the entire model themselves. The input_avl.py file takes the provided parameter and creates an .avl file from this that can be read by AVL (the program). This happens in the process.sh file. The necessary output generated by AVL will be saved in two files: custom_vehicle_body_axis_derivatives.txt and custom_vehicle_stability_derivatives.txt. These two files contain the parameters that are required in order to populate the Advanced Lift Drag Plugin. Finally, avl_out_parse.py reads the generated .txt files and accordingly assigns parameters to the correct element in sdf. Once this is done, it is only a question of copy and pasting the generated Advanced Lift Drag plugin (found as <custom_plane>.sdf into the desired model.sdf file. )

## Setup

In order to run this program, it is necessary to follow these steps:

1. Download AVL 3.36 from <https://web.mit.edu/drela/Public/web/avl/>. The file for AVL version 3.36 can be found about halfway down the page.
2. After downloading, extract AVL and move it to the home directory using:

```shell
sudo tar -xf avl3.36.tgz
mv ./Avl /home/
```

Follow the README.md found in Avl to finish the setup process for AVL (requires to set up plotlib and eispack libraries). When running the Makefile for AVL, you might encounter an Error 1 message stating that there is a directory missing. This does not prevent AVL from working for our purposes. Once this process is completed, AVL is ready to be used.


Running individual parts: run just one section TODO: provide custom commands to do this.

## Run

To run the program all that is needed is to modify the input.yml to the plane that you desire and then run `python input_avl.py`. Note that you require to have the yaml and argparse packages in your python environment to run this.


## IMPORTANT POINTS TO NOTE
A control surface in AVL is always defined from left to right. This means you need to first provide the left edge of a surface and then the right edge. If you do this the opposite way around, a surface will essentially be defined upside down.

Another important point is that these scripts make use of the match, case syntax, which was only introducd in Python in version 3.10.
