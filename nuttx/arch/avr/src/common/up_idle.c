 * Name: up_idle
 *
 * Description:
 *   up_idle() is the logic that will be executed when their
 *   is no other ready-to-run task.  This is processor idle
 *   time and will continue until some interrupt occurs to
 *   cause a context switch from the idle task.
 *
 *   Processing in this state may be processor-specific. e.g.,
 *   this is where power management operations might be
 *   performed.
