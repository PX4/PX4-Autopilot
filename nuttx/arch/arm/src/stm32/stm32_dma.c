/* This file is only a thin shell that includes the correct DMA implementation
 * for the selected STM32 family.  The correct file cannot be selected by
 * the make system because it needs the intelligence that only exists in
 * chip.h that can associate an STM32 part number with an STM32 family.
 *
 * The STM32 F4 DMA differs from the F1 DMA primarily in that it adds the
 * concept of "streams" that are used to associate DMA sources with DMA
 * channels.
