/** Waste CPU Time
 * 
 *   up_waste() is the logic that will be executed when portions of kernel
 *   or user-app is polling some register or similar, waiting for desired
 *   status. This time is wasted away. This function offers a measure of
 *   badly written piece of software or some undesired behavior.
 *
 *   At the same time this function adds to some IDLE time which portion
 *   cannot be used for other purposes (yet).
