/* This file is only a thin shell that includes the correct RTC implementation
 * for the selected STM32 family.  The correct file cannot be selected by
 * the make system because it needs the intelligence that only exists in
 * chip.h that can associate an STM32 part number with an STM32 family.
 *
 * The STM32 F4 RTC differs dramatically the F1 RTC.  The F1 RTC is a simple
 * battery-backed counter; the F4 RTC is provides broken-out data/time in BCD
 * format.
