General Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.nxp.com/pip/LPC2141FBD64.html:

The LPC2141/42/44/46/48 microcontrollers are based on a 16-bit/32-bit ARM7TDMI-S
CPU with real-time emulation and embedded trace support, that combine
microcontroller with embedded high-speed flash memory ranging from 32 kB to
512 kB. A 128-bit wide memory interface and a unique accelerator architecture
enable 32-bit code execution at the maximum clock rate. For critical code size
applications, the alternative 16-bit Thumb mode reduces code by more than 30 pct
with minimal performance penalty. 

Due to their tiny size and low power consumption, LPC2141/42/44/46/48 are ideal
for applications where miniaturization is a key requirement, such as access
control and point-of-sale. Serial communications interfaces ranging from a USB 2.0
Full-speed device, multiple UARTs, SPI, SSP to I2C-bus and on-chip SRAM of 8 kB
up to 40 kB, make these devices very well suited for communication gateways and
protocol converters, soft modems, voice recognition and low end imaging, providing
both large buffer size and high processing power. Various 32-bit timers, single
or dual 10-bit ADC(s), 10-bit DAC, PWM channels and 45 fast GPIO lines with up
to nine edge or level sensitive external interrupt pins make these microcontrollers
suitable for industrial control and medical systems.
