The MMU translates every memory address from 16 to 20 bits.  The MMU uses
three internal control registers. On reset the MMU gives a straight logical
to physical mapping, simulating the Z80 and, of course, limiting the address
space to 64k.

Logical Address Spaces
======================

The 64KB CPU logical address space is interpreted by the MMU as consisting
of up to three separate logical address areas:

  Common Area 0,
  Bank Area, and
  Common Area 1.

Common 0, if it exists, always starts at logical address 0000 and runs up
to the Bank Area. The Bank Area then runs to the start of Common Area 1.

Registers
=========

CBAR (Comman/Bank Area Register)

  CBAR is an 8 bit I/O port that can be accessed by the processor's OUT and
  IN instructions. The lower 4-bits of CBAR (BA) specify the starting logical
  address of the Bank Area, and the upper 4-bits (CA) give the start of
  Common Area 1. These bits determine the upper four bits of the 16-bit
  address. If CBAR were 0xa8, then the Base Area starts at logical address
  0x8000 and Common Area 1 starts at logical address 0xa000.  This gives a
  mapping granualarity of 4Kb in the logical address space.

  The CA and BA fields of CBAR may be freely programmed subject only to the
  restriction that CA may never be less than BA.

BBAR (Base Area Bank Register)

  BBR  specifies the starting physical address of the base area (the logical
  start address is in CBAR).

CBR (Common Bank Register)

  CBR provides the same information for Common Area 1.

Both the BBAR and the CBR specify the upper 8-bits of the 20-bit physical
address in the mapping.  Hence, mapping is performed with a granularity of
4Kb in the physical address space.

Physical to Logical Address Mapping
===================================

A simple formula gives the translation from logical to physical address for
the Bank Area:

  Physical = Logical + (BBR * 4096)

The same formula gives Common Area 1:

  Physical = Logical + (CBR * 4096)

Reset Configuration
===================

On reset, the CBAR is set to 0xf0, and CBR and BBR are set to 0x00. This
maps logical to physical with no translation; the Bank Area starts at
logical address 0x0000 and Common 1 at 0xf000. The Bank Area starts at
phsycial address 0x00000 (BBR=0), as does Common Area 1 (CBR=0). If the
logical address is 0x1000, then the MMU allocates this to the Bank Area
and adds the physical base of bank to it (0x00000), giving a translated
address of 0x01000. Similarly, logical 0xf800 is in Common Area 1, and
translates to 0x0f800.

Configurations
==============

You can divide the logical address space into one, two, or three areas.

1) Three areas:

  CBAR:CA > CBAR:BA > 0x0000

2a) Two areas (Bank Area and Common Area 1):

  CBAR:CA > CBAR:BA = 0x0000

2a) Two areas (Common Area 0 and Common Area 1):

  CBAR:CA = CBAR:BA > 0x0000

3) One area (Common Area 1):

  CBAR:CA = CBAR:BA = 0x0000

NuttX Memory Organization
=========================

Common Area 0:  This area holds the common NuttX code that is directly
call-able from all application threads.  Common Area always starts at
logical address 0x0000 and extends to the Bank Area

Base Area: This area holds the common NuttX data (including the share-
able heap) that is accessible from all applications and extends to
Common Area 1.

NOTE:  That is execution from RAM, the common NuttX code and data may
be contiguous and lie in the same areas (either Common Area 0 or the
Bank Area).  The two areas above would apply in a ROM'ed system, where
Common Area 1 is ROM and the Base Area is RAM.

Common Area 1:  This area holds the code and data that is unique to
a particular task.  This area extends to the end of the logical address
space.  All tasks share the same logical Common Area 2 logical address
(in the CBAR), but each has a unique mapping to different, underlying
physical addresses. Each task will then have its own, unique CBR value
that must be restored with each context switch to the task.
