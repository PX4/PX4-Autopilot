 * Name: nx_requestbkgd
 *
 * Description:
 *   NX normally controls a separate window called the background window.
 *   It repaints the window as necessary using only a solid color fill.  The
 *   background window always represents the entire screen and is always
 *   below other windows.  It is useful for an application to control the
 *   background window in the following conditions:
 *
 *   - If you want to implement a windowless solution.  The single screen
 *     can be used to creat a truly simple graphic environment.  In this
 *     case, you should probably also de-select CONFIG_NX_MULTIUSER as well.
 *   - When you want more on the background than a solid color.  For
 *     example, if you want an image in the background, or animations in the
 *     background, or live video, etc.
 *
 *   This API only requests the handle of the background window.  That
 *   handle will be returned asynchronously in a subsequent position and
 *   redraw callbacks.
 *
 *
 *   Cautions:
 *   - The following should never be called using the background window.
 *     They are guaranteed to cause severe crashes:
 *
 *       nx_setposition, nx_setsize, nx_raise, nx_lower.
 *
 *   - Neither nx_opengbwindow or nx_closebgwindow should be called more than
 *     once.  Multiple instances of the background window are not supported.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   handle - The handle returned by nx_connect
 *   cb     - Callbacks to use for processing background window events
 *   arg    - User provided argument (see nx_openwindow, nx_constructwindow)
 *
 * Return:
 *   OK: Success; ERROR of failure with errno set appropriately.
