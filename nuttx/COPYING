FAT Long File Names
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  NOTE:  If CONFIG_FAT_LFN is defined in your NuttX configuration file, then
  there may be some legal, patent issues. The following was extracted from
  the entry "File Allocation Table from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:

    "On December 3, 2003 Microsoft announced it would be offering licenses
     for use of its FAT specification and 'associated intellectual property',
     at the cost of a US$0.25 royalty per unit sold, with a $250,000 maximum
     royalty per license agreement.

     o "U.S. Patent 5,745,902 (http://www.google.com/patents?vid=5745902) -
        Method and system for accessing a file using file names having
        different file name formats. ...
     o "U.S. Patent 5,579,517 (http://www.google.com/patents?vid=5579517) -
        Common name space for long and short filenames. ...
     o "U.S. Patent 5,758,352 (http://www.google.com/patents?vid=5758352) -
        Common name space for long and short filenames. ...
     o "U.S. Patent 6,286,013 (http://www.google.com/patents?vid=6286013) -
        Method and system for providing a common name space for long and
        short file names in an operating system. ...
 
    "Many technical commentators have concluded that these patents only cover
     FAT implementations that include support for long filenames, and that
     removable solid state media and consumer devices only using short names
     would be unaffected. ..."

  This Wikipedia entry has been updated with recent legal decisions in favor
  of Microsoft. Refer to:
  
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table#Legal_issues

  So you have been forewarned:  Use the long filename at your own risk!

uIP
^^^

Many lower-level networking components of NuttX derive from uIP which
has a similar BSD style license:

IGMP
^^^^

IGMP support, if enabled in uIP, adds additional logic by Steve Reynolds:

Certain functions in the NuttX C-library derive from other BSD-compatible
sources:

     Copyright (c) 2004 Marius Aamodt Eriksen <marius@umich.edu>.

   The University of Michigan uses a modified BSD license equivalent to
   the NuttX license.  The University of California code uses the original
   BSD license and requires that I state the following:

dtoa():
^^^^^^

  If you enable floating point conversions with CONFIG_LIBC_FLOATINGPOINT,
  then some files with an unmodified BSD license will be included.  That
  license is similar to the above (modified) BSD license, but has an
  additional requirement that I state the following:

  "This product includes software developed by the University of
   California, Berkeley and its contributors."

libc/string/lib_vikmemcpy.c
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  If you enable CONFIG_MEMCPY_VIK, then you will build with the optimized
  version of memcpy from Daniel Vik.  Licensing information for that version
  of memcpy() follows:

libc/math
^^^^^^^^^

  If you enable CONFIG_LIB, you will build the math library at libc/math.
  This library was taken from the math library developed for the Rhombus
  OS by Nick Johnson (https://github.com/nickbjohnson4224/rhombus).  This
  port was contributed by Darcy Gong.  The Rhombus math library has this
  compatible MIT license:
