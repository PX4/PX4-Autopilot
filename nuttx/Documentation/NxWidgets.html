<h1>NXWidgets</h1>
<p>
  In order to better support NuttX based platforms, a special graphical userinterface has been created called NXWidgets.
  NXWidgets is written in C++ and integrates seamlessly with the NuttX NX graphics subsystem in order to provide graphic objects, or &quot;widgets,&quot; in the NX Graphics Subsystem
</p>
<p>
  Some of the features of NXWidgets include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Conservative C++</b>.
    NXWidgets is written entirely in C++ but using only selected &quot;embedded friendly&quot; C++ constructs that are fully supported under NuttX.
    No additional C++ support libraries are required.
  </li>
  <li><b>NX Integration</b>.
    NXWidgets integrate seamlessly with the NX graphics system.
    Think of the X server under Linux … the NX graphics system is like a tiny X server that provides windowing under NuttX.
    By adding NXWidgets, you can support graphics objects like buttons and text boxes in the NX windows and toolbars.
  </li>
  <li><b>Small Footprint</b>.
    NXWidgets is tailored for use MCUs in embedded applications.
    It is ideally suited for mid- and upper-range of most MCU families.
    A complete NXWidgets is possible in as little as 40Kb of FLASH and maybe 4Kb of SRAM.
  </li>
  <li><b>Output Devices</b>.
    NXWidgets will work on the high-end frame buffer devices as well as on LCDs connected via serial or parallel ports to a small MCU.
  </li>
  <li><b>Input Devices</b>.
    NXWidgets will accept position and selection inputs from a mouse or a touchscreen.
    It will also support character input from a keyboard such as a USB keyboard.
    NXWidgets supports on very special widget called CKeypad that will provide keyboard input via an on-screen keypad that can be operated via mouse or touchscreen inputs.
  </li>
  <li><b>Many Graphic Objects</b>.
    Some of the graphic objects supported by NXWidgets include labels, buttons, text boxes, button arrays, check boxes, cycle buttons, images, sliders, scrollable list boxes, progress bars, and more.
  </li>
  <li><b>DOxygen Documentation</ba>
    DOxygen documentation is available.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Note:  Many of the fundamental classed in NxWidgets derive from the Antony
  Dzeryn's &quot;Woopsi&quot; project: http://woopsi.org/ which also has a BSD style
  license.  See the COPYING file for details.
