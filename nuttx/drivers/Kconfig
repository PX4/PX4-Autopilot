comment "Device Driver Configuration"

config DEV_NULL
	bool "Enable /dev/null"
	default y

config DEV_ZERO
	bool "Enable /dev/zero"
	default y

config LOOP
	bool "Enable loop device"
	default n
	---help---
		Supports the standard loop device that can be used to export a
		file (or character device) as a block device.  See losetup() and
		loteardown() in include/nuttx/fs/fs.h.

config RAMDISK
	bool "RAM disk support"
	default n
	---help---
		Can be used to set up a block of memory or (read-only) FLASH as
		a block driver that can be mounted as a files system.  See
		include/nuttx/ramdisk.h.

config RAMLOG
	bool "RAM log message support"
	default n
	---help---
		This is a driver that was intended to support debugging output,
		aka syslogging, when the normal serial output is not available.
		For example, if you are using a telnet or USB serial console,
		the debug output will get lost.

		This driver is similar to a pipe in that it saves the debugging
		output in a FIFO in RAM.  It differs from a pipe in numerous
		details as needed to support logging.

if RAMLOG
config RAMLOG_SYSLOG
	bool "Use RAMLOG for SYSLOG"
	default n
	depends on SYSLOG
	---help---
		Use the RAM logging device for the syslogging interface.  If this feature
		is enabled (along with SYSLOG), then all debug output (only) will be re-directed
		to the circular buffer in RAM.  This RAM log can be view from NSH using the
		'dmesg'command.

config RAMLOG_CONSOLE
	bool "Use RAMLOG for /dev/console"
	default n
	depends on DEV_CONSOLE
	---help---
		Use the RAM logging device as a system console. If this feature is enabled (along
		with DEV_CONSOLE), then all console output will be re-directed to a circular
		buffer in RAM.  This is useful, for example, if the only console is a Telnet
		console.  Then in that case, console output from non-Telnet threads will go to
		the circular buffer and can be viewed using the NSH 'dmesg' command.

config RAMLOG_CONSOLE_BUFSIZE
	int "RAMLOG buffer size"
	default 1024
	depends on RAMLOG_SYSLOG || RAMLOG_CONSOLE
	---help---
		Size of the console RAM log.  Default: 1024

config RAMLOG_CRLF
	bool "RAMLOG CR/LF"
	default n
	---help---
		Pre-pend a carriage return before every linefeed that goes into the RAM log.

config RAMLOG_NONBLOCKING
	bool "RAMLOG non-block reads"
	default y
	---help---
		Reading from the RAMLOG will never block if the RAMLOG is empty.  If the RAMLOG
		is empty, then zero is returned (usually interpreted as end-of-file).

config RAMLOG_NPOLLWAITERS
	int "RAMLOG number of poll waiters"
	default 4
	depends on !DISABLE_POLL
	---help---
		The maximum number of threads that may be waiting on the poll method.

endif

config CAN
	bool "CAN support"
	default n
	---help---
		This selection enables building of the "upper-half" CAN driver.
		See include/nuttx/can.h for further CAN driver information.

if CAN
config CAN_EXTID
	bool "CAN extended IDs"
	default n
	---help---
		Enables support for the 29-bit extended ID.  Default Standard 11-bit IDs.

config CAN_FIFOSIZE
	int "CAN driver I/O buffer size"
	default 8
	---help---
		The size of the circular buffer of CAN messages. Default: 8

config CAN_NPENDINGRTR
	int "Number of pending RTRs"
	default 4
	---help---
		The size of the list of pending RTR requests. Default: 4

config CAN_LOOPBACK
	bool "CAN extended IDs"
	default n
	---help---
		A CAN driver may or may not support a loopback mode for testing. If the
		driver does support loopback mode, the setting will enable it. (If the
		driver does not, this setting will have no effect).

endif

config PWM
	bool "PWM support"
	default n
	---help---
		This selection enables building of the "upper-half" PWM driver.
		See include/nuttx/pwm.h for further PWM driver information.

if PWM
config PWM_PULSECOUNT
	bool "PWM pulse count support"
	default n
	---help---
		Some hardware will support generation of a fixed number of pulses.  This
		might be used, for example to support a stepper motor.  If the hardware
		will support a fixed pulse count, then this configuration should be set to
		enable the capability.

endif

config I2C
	bool "I2C support"
	default y
	---help---
		This selection enables building of the "upper-half" I2C driver.
		See include/nuttx/i2c.h for further I2C driver information.

if I2C
endif

config SPI
	bool "SPI support"
	default y
	---help---
		This selection enables building of the "upper-half" SPI driver.
		See include/nuttx/spi.h for further SPI driver information.

if SPI
config SPI_OWNBUS
	bool "SPI single device"
	default y
	---help---
		Set if there is only one active device on the SPI bus.  No locking or SPI
		configuration will be performed. It is not necessary for clients to lock,
		re-configure, etc..

config SPI_EXCHANGE
	bool "SPI exchange"
	default y
	---help---
		Driver supports a single exchange method (vs a recvblock() and sndblock ()methods).

config SPI_CMDDATA
	bool "SPI CMD/DATA"
	default y
	---help---
		Devices on the SPI bus require out-of-band support to distinguish command
		transfers from data transfers.  Such devices will often support either 9-bit
		SPI (yech) or 8-bit SPI and a GPIO output that selects between command and data.

endif

config WATCHDOG
	bool "Watchdog timer support"
	default y
	---help---
		This selection enables building of the "upper-half" watchdog timer driver.
		See include/nuttx/watchdog.h for further watchdog timer driver information.

if WATCHDOG
endif

menuconfig ANALOG
	bool "Analog Device(ADC/DAC) support"
	default n
	---help---

		This includes drivers for Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC) as
		well as drivers for Digital to Analog Conversion (DAC).
		See include/nuttx/analog/*.h for registration information.
if ANALOG
source drivers/analog/Kconfig
endif

config BCH
	bool "BCH support"
	default n
	---help---
		Contains logic that may be used to convert a block driver into
		a character driver.  This is the complementary conversion as that
		performed by loop.c.  See include/nuttx/fs/fs.h for registration
		information.
if BCH
source drivers/bch/Kconfig
endif

menuconfig INPUT
	bool "Input device support"
	default y
	---help---

if INPUT
source drivers/input/Kconfig
endif

menuconfig LCD
	bool "LCD support"
	default n

if LCD
source drivers/lcd/Kconfig
endif

menuconfig MMCSD
	bool "MMC/SD support"
	default n
	---help---
		Support for MMC/SD block drivers.  MMC/SD block drivers based on
		SPI and SDIO/MCI interfaces are supported.  See include/nuttx/mmcsd.h
		and include/nuttx/sdio.h for further information.

if MMCSD
source drivers/mmcsd/Kconfig
endif
	
menuconfig MTD
	bool "Memory Technology Device (MTD) support"
	default n
	---help---
		Memory Technology Device (MTD) drivers.  Some simple drivers for
		memory technologies like FLASH, EEPROM, NVRAM, etc.  See
		include/nuttx/mtd.h

		(Note: This is a simple memory interface and should not be
		confused with the "real" MTD developed at infradead.org.  This
		logic is unrelated; I just used the name MTD because I am not
		aware of any other common way to refer to this class of devices).
if MTD
source drivers/mtd/Kconfig
endif

menuconfig NETDEVICES
	bool "Network Device support"
	default n
	---help---
		Network interface drivers.  See also include/nuttx/net/net.h
if NETDEVICES

endif

menuconfig PIPES
	bool "FIFO and named pipe drivers"
	default n

		in include/unistd.h
if PIPES
source drivers/pipes/Kconfig
endif

menuconfig POWER
	bool "Power management (PM) driver interfaces"
	default n
	---help---
		Power management (PM) driver interfaces.  These interfaces are used
		to manage power usage of a platform by monitoring driver activity
		and by placing drivers into reduce power usage modes when the
		drivers are not active.
if POWER

endif

menuconfig SENSORS

endif

menuconfig SERCOMM_CONSOLE
	bool "Osmocom-bb serial console"
	default n
	---help---
		Sercomm is the transport used by osmocom-bb that runs on top of serial.
		See http://bb.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/nuttx-bb/run for detailed the usage
		of nuttx with sercomm.

		drivers/sercomm is only built if SERCOMM_CONSOLE in the NuttX
		configuration file.  If you attempt to build this driver without
		osmocom-bb, you will get compilation errors because of header files
		that are needed from the osmocom-bb.
if SERCOMM
source drivers/sercomm/Kconfig
endif

menuconfig SERIAL
	bool "Serial support"
	default y
	---help---
