menuconfig RTC
	bool "RTC Driver Support"
	default n
	---help---
		This selection enables configuration of a real time clock (RTCdriver.
		See include/nuttx/rtc.h for further watchdog timer driver information.
		Most RTC drivers are MCU specific and may require other specific

config RTC_DATETIME
	bool "Date/Time RTC Support"
	default n
	depends on RTC
	---help---
		There are two general types of RTC:  (1) A simple battery backed
		counter that keeps the time when power is down, and (2) a full
		date / time RTC the provides the date and time information, often in
		BCD format.  If RTC_DATETIME is selected, it specifies this second kind
		of RTC. In this case, the RTC is used to "seed" the normal NuttX timer
		and the NuttX system timer provides for higher resolution time.

config RTC_HIRES
	bool "Hi-Res RTC Support"
	default n
	depends on RTC && !RTC_DATETIME
	---help---
		If RTC_DATETIME not selected, then the simple, battery backed counter
		is used.  There are two different implementations of such simple
		counters based on the time resolution of the counter: The typical RTC
		keeps time to resolution of 1 second, usually supporting a 32-bit
		time_t value.  In this case, the RTC is used to "seed" the normal NuttX
		timer and the NuttX timer provides for higherresoution time.

		If RTC_HIRES is enabled in the NuttX configuration, then the RTC
		provides higher resolution time and completely replaces the system
		timer for purpose of date and time.

config RTC_FREQUENCY
	int "Hi-Res RTC frequency"
	default 1
	depends on RTC && !RTC_DATETIME && RTC_HIRES
	---help---
		If RTC_HIRES is defined, then the frequency of the high resolution RTC
		must be provided.  If RTC_HIRES is not defined, RTC_FREQUENCY is
		assumed to be one Hz.

config RTC_ALARM 
	bool "RTC Alarm Support"
	default n
	depends on RTC
	---help---
		Enable if the RTC hardware supports setting of an alarm.  A callback
		function will be executed when the alarm goes off.

menuconfig WATCHDOG
	bool "Watchdog Timer Support"
	default n
	---help---
		This selection enables building of the "upper-half" watchdog timer
		driver. See include/nuttx/watchdog.h for further watchdog timer driver
		information.

		performed by loop.c.  See include/nuttx/fs/fs.h for registration
		information.

		memory technologies like FLASH, EEPROM, NVRAM, etc.  See
		include/nuttx/mtd.h

		(Note: This is a simple memory interface and should not be
		confused with the "real" MTD developed at infradead.org.  This
		logic is unrelated; I just used the name MTD because I am not
		aware of any other common way to refer to this class of devices).

		See http://bb.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/nuttx-bb/run for detailed the usage
		of nuttx with sercomm.

		drivers/sercomm is only built if SERCOMM_CONSOLE in the NuttX
