0.1.0 2007-03-09  Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* Initial Release
	* Support for Linux user mode simulation and TI
	  TMS320C5471 (Arm7) provided

0.1.1 2007-03-14  Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* Corrected an error in interrupt level context switching
	  for C5471
	* Added fgets() and gets() logic; verified c5471 console read.
	* Corrected error in reading from the C5471 serial port:
	  Improper use of semaphore can cause deadlock.
	* Fixed an error in the memory cleanup:  The idle task
	  cannot take sempahores (because it must always be ready
	  to run).
	* Tasks can now accept a configurable maximum number of
	  input parameters (argc)
	* _task_init() was divided into separate functions that
	  require fewer parameters.  This was necessary to keep
	  the stack usage down for the 8051/2 (which has only
	  256 bytes of stack).
	* Attempts to use C5471 console from interrupt handlers
	  can cause errors. Added a special path for this case.
	* Refuse calls to sem_wait and sem_trywait from interrupt
	  handlers.  This was happening because interrupt handlers
	  were calling printf-like functions.
	* Added strtok() and strtok_r()
	* Added a simple shell called nsh (see examples/nsh).
	* Platform support for 8052 is complete but not stable
	  when the timer interrupt is enabled.	Seems to be an
	  issue when SP enters indirect address space.
	* Documentation updates

0.1.2 2007-03-19  Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* Add dirent.h, opendir(), readdir(), closedir(), etc.
	* Add strerror()
	* Added 'ls' command to nsh
	* Added C5471 watchdog driver
	* Fixed another bug where free() is called from IDLE task.
	  Can't do this; the caller must be able to wait for access
	  to memory.
	* Fixed bugs associated with debug output:
	  Cannot do dbg() in middle of context switch logic.
	  because it may require use of semaphores and cause
	  additional context switches. lldbg() is safe.
	* Interrupt must be disabled throughout all context switches.
	* Separated C5471 serial driver; a shareable part is
	  in drivers/. ; the C5471 specific part is in arch/C5471.
	  serial.h defines the interface.
	* Fixed mq_receive() and mq_send(): bad memcpy()
	* Fixed C5471 signal deliver logic: use of dbg() and
	  other actions by use signal handler can alter errno.
	  need to protect errno during signal handling.
	* Fixed uninitialized variable in filesystem that could
	  cause various problems
	* Added a test for roundrobin scheduler.

0.2.1 2007-03-22  Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* Fix error in handing signed decimal in vsprintf().
	* Major restructuring of header files to get closer to
	  POSIX compliance.

	* Some Documentation updates
	* Added support for the Neuros OSD / DM320

0.2.2 2007-03-26 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>
	* Created the configs/ directory; separated board configuration
	  from processor architecture logic
	* Add memory leak detection test to examples/ostest
	* Corrected memory leak in OS pthread join logic
	* Corrected memory leaks in examples/ostest due to failures
	  to join or detach from pthreads.
	* Added pthread_once(), pthread_kill(), pthread_sigmask()
	* Added pthread_barrierattr_*() APIs
	* Added pthread_barrier_init(), pthread_barrier_destroy(), and
	  pthread_barrier_wait();
	* Added pthread barrier test
	* Added protection so that errno cannot be modified from
	  interrupt handling.
	* sched_setparam(), sched_setscheduler() now correctly set
	  errno; pthread_setscheduler() now returns the correct errno.
	* Added pthread_setschedprio().
	* Added directories to hold board-specific header files
	* Added directories to hold board-specific drivers

0.2.3 2007-03-29 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* mq_receive and mq_send now return errno's appropriately
	* mq_receive and mq_send are now correctly awakened by signals.
	* Fixed an unmatched sched_lock/unlock pair in task_delete().
	* sched_lock must be called in _exit() because operation of
	  task_delete() can cause pending tasks to be merged and a
	  context switch to occur.
	* Added mq_timedreceive() and mq_timedsend()
	* signal mask is now inherited by both child tasks and threads.
	* Improved sharebility of stdout among pthreads (only).  Nothing
	  was broken, but by moving the mutual exclusion logic to a
	  higher level, the printf output is more readable.
	* Fixed a bug in file system cleanup:  A list was being deleted
	  before the buffers contained in the list.
	* Fixed a bug in the wait-for-message-queue-not-empty logic.
	* Added a test of timed mqueue operations; detected and corrected
	  some mqueue errors.
	* Identified and corrected a race condition associated with
	  pthread_join.  In the failure condition, memory was being
	  deallocated while still in use.

0.2.4 2007-04-28 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* Verified c5471 build under Cygwin on WinXP
	* Makesystem changes to better support different SoCs.
	* Made arch/c5471/include and arch/dm320/include identical in
	  preparation for merging into arch/arm
	* Logic from arch/c5471 and arch/dm320 combined into arch/arm.
	  arch/c5471 and arch/dm320 are deprecated and will be removed
	  when the new c5471 and dm320 logic is verified.

	* Restructured some Makefiles to better handle enabling and disabling
	  NuttX features without having so much conditional compilation in the
	  source files.
	* tools/mkconfig.c: No longer depends on asprintf() and _GNU_SOURCE and
	  so should now build in non-GNU, non-GLIBC environments.

	* Correct the frequency of system timer interrupts in the NXP LPC214x port
	  (off by 20x in nuttx-0.3.15)
	* Add an option to set aside a separate stack for interrupt handling (ARM only).
	  This is useful when memory is constrained, there are multiple tasks, and
	  the interrupt stack requirement is high (as when USB is enabled).
	* Added USB serial class device side driver (emulates Prolific PL2303
	  serial-to-USB adaptor)
	* Add LPC214x USB serial configuration; Add examples/usbserial test

	  system timer.
	* Fixed serial driver bugs related to (1) open counts and (2) recognizing
	  O_NONBLOCK on read.

	  endpoints (other than EP) on receipt of CLEAR FEATURES request.
	* Added USB storage class device side driver (BBB)
	* Fixed a bug in the LPC214x USB driver: It was not properly handling request buffers
	  larger then the endpoint's max packet (DM320 driver also fixed, untested)
	* Added logic to the USB device interface:	A bit is needed to force the driver to
	  to terminate an IN transfer with a short packet (zero-length if necessary).
	* Fix an error in the NXP LPC214x USB device driver that was causing corruption of
	  the request queue (M320 driver also fixed, untested)
	* Correct another error in the NXP LPC214x USB device driver that caused read failures
	  when the request buffer size was larger than maxpacket.
	* Numerous corrections/extensions to the USB tracing logic included in 0.3.16 (but
	  not integrated until 0.3.17)
	* Fixed another bug in the NXP LPC214x USB device driver:  After a stalled endpoint
	  is resumed (view CLEAR FEATURE), we must restart the IN (outgoing) queue.

0.3.18 2008-11-16 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>
	* Added port for the STMicro STR71x processor and configuration for the Olimex STR-P711
	  board (STR71x testing is stalled because I have been unable to get OpenOCD to
	  communicate with my JTAG wiggler on Linux).
	* Fix race condition workaround delay in LPC214X SPI logic.  This was also the cause of the
	  very bad MMC/SD performance.
	* Began port of the Hitachi SH-1 using the SH-1/US7032EVB1 board
	* Re-built all configurations that use SDCC and Zilog toolchains to make sure they still
	  build (they didn't, but they do now).
	* Fixed several erroneous "list empty" checks in the CAN driver.
	* Hitachi SH-1 passes (reduced) examples/ostest; the examples/nsh test still fails.
	  There are remaining instabilities that make the port un-usable.  The nature of these is
	  not understood; the behavior is that certain SH-1 instructions stop working as advertised.
	  This could be a silicon problem, some pipeline issue that is not handled properly by the
	  gcc 3.4.5 toolchain (which has very limit SH-1 support to begin with), or perhaps with the
	  CMON debugger.  At any rate, I have exhausted all of the energy that I am willing to put
	  into this cool old processor for the time being.
	* Renamed configuration item CONFIG_PROC_STACK_SIZE as CONFIG_IDLETHREAD_STACKSIZE:  It now
	  only controls the size of the stack for the IDLE thread.	Added CONFIG_USERMAIN_STACKSIZE:
	  This is the size of stack used with the user_start() thread is created.  The two stacks
	  no longer have to be the same.
	* Add a loop device that converts a file into a block device.
	* Each NSH command can not be disabled through a configuration setting. All of these
	 settings make the configuration of NSH potentially complex but also allow it to squeeze
	  into very small memory footprints.
	* Added a block to character (BCH) driver.	This is kind of the reverse of the loop
	  device; it allows you access a block device like a character device.
	* Added strcasecmp() and strncasecmp()
	* NSH: Added the 'dd' command
	* NSH: Added the 'losetup' command
	* Fixed a FAT bug:	After recent changes, it would mount a (invalid) FAT file system
	  even if the medium is not formatted!
	* Corrected two important errors in FAT lseek implementation: (1) the sectors-per-cluster
	  value was being reset to "1" and (2) important lseek logic was omitted when the seek
	  position was zero.
	* Fixed a bug in getopt().	It would fail if on certain combinations of terminal argument
	  types.

0.3.19 2008-11-26 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>
	* Add poll() and select() APIs (in the initial check-in, these work only with character devices) 
	* Add poll() methods to /dev/null, /dev/zero, pipes, fifos, and serial drivers.
	* Add examples/poll for testing poll() and select()
	* Fix hostile behavior of getc, fgetc, getchar, etc.: the serial driver was waiting for a
	  full buffer of read data before return.  This means that getc would stall when it needed
	  to refill the input buffer. The old behavior (read full blocks) might be useful in other
	  contexts, so it is still available within the driver as a configuration option.
	* Implement poll() and select() support for TCP/IP sockets
	* Fixed an important bug in the TCP/IP buffering logic.  When TCP/IP read-ahead is enabled
	  and not recv() is in-place when a TCP/IP packet is received, the packet is placed into
	  a read-ahead buffer.	However, the old contents of the read-ahead buffer were not being
	  cleared and old data would contaminate the newly received buffer.
	* Implemented support for connection backlog.  The size of the backlog is specified by the
	  second argument of the standard listen() API.  Hooks are provided to support poll()/select()
	  waiting for connections, with a subsequent call to accept() to use the backlogged connection.
	* Fixed a minor bug in accept().  It should allow the address and addresslen values to be NULL
	* Added first-cut definition for a framebuffer interface (and simulated framebuffer for testing
	  purposes only)
	* Added fixed precision math support
	* Added some color converson routines into what may become a real graphics library someday.
	* Added a framebuffer driver for the DM320 (untested on initial check-in)
	* Network: add support for outgoing multicast addresses
	* Added some rasterizers to the graphics library

0.4.0 2008-12-06 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>
	* Initial release of a tiny windowing system for NuttX
	* Add fixed precision sin() and cos() (not well tested at initial check-in)
	* Add an X11-based simulated framebuffer driver
	* The simulated target now has an option (CONFIG_SIM_WALLTIME) that will let the simulation
	  run in more-or-less realtime.
	* Added more extensive window support:  frames, toolbars, etc.
	* Added support for bitmap fonts
	* Integrated the new font support with a font test in examples/nx
	* Add documentation for NX graphics subsystem

0.4.1 2009-02-06 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>
	* Added board support for the ZiLog eZ80Acclaim! ez80f910200zco Development Kit.
	* Fixed several compilation errors in fixed precision math library when built
	  against toolchains that do not support 64-bit type 'long long'.
	* Fix errors in some function prototypes in dirent.h
	* Add eZ80F91 EMAC driver
	* Fix recvfrom() compilation error: only noted under ZDS
	* Updated all ARM Make.def files to work with gcc 2.4.2 (However, there are
	  still some build issues associated with that toolchain in use of arm-elf-objcopy
	  -- see the TODO.txt list for details)
	* Fix problems with Z16F and eZ80 compilation introduced with recent changes.

0.4.2 2009-02-28 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* M16C: Add support for the Renesas M16C MCU and the SKP16C26 StarterKit. However, 
	  the target cannot be built because the GNU m16c-elf-ld link fails with 
	  the following message:

		m32c-elf-ld: BFD (GNU Binutils) 2.19 assertion fail /home/Owner/projects/nuttx/buildroot/toolchain_build_m32c/binutils-2.19/bfd/elf32-m32c.c:482

	  Where the reference line is:

		/* If the symbol is out of range for a 16-bit address,
		   we must have allocated a plt entry.	*/
		 BFD_ASSERT (*plt_offset != (bfd_vma) -1);

	  No workaround is known at this time.	This is a show stopper for M16C.

	* eZ80Acclaim!: Fix interrupt vectors positioning; they were being positioned
	  wrong by 64 bytes (Kevin Franzen).
	* eZ80Acclaim!: Corrected some stack handling errors during interrupt handling
	   context save and restore (Kevin Franzen).
	* eZ80Acclaim!: Corrected vector intialization logic (Kevin Franzen).
	* eZ80Acclaim!: Corrected overflow problem in the calculation of UART baud rate
		divisor, the system timer divisor, and the EMAC poll timer.
	* eZ80Acclaim!: Fixed GPIO pin configuration get serial output
	* eZ80Acclaim!: Correct stack overflow in ostest example configuration
	* eZ80Acclaim!: Fixed restoration of interrupts state on interrupt level context swith.

0.4.3 2009-03-04 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* z8Encore! and eZ80Acclaim!: Fixed the serial driver initialization sequence
	* eZ80Acclaim!: Fixed error in vector table:  Missing space set aside for the
	  "unused" vectors.  As a result, all vectors above timer4 were skewed.
	* eZ80Acclaim!: Fixed logic error in UART interrupt handler.
	* Many fixes in FAT file system and in NSH for correct compilation with ZDS-II
	* eZ80Acclaim!: Added and verified a NuttShell (NSH) configuration.
	* eZ80Acclaim!: Correct endian-ness; defconfig files said BIG endian.
	* Restructured parts of the uIP port for correct compilation with ZDS-II
	* eZ80Acclaim!: Complete basic integration of the eZ80F91 EMAC driver.	The
	  driver is basically functional and should mature prior to the 0.4.3 release.
	* Implemented priority inheritance logic for POSIX semaphores.	Because the pthread
	  mutexes are built on semaphores, they will have this property as well.

0.4.4 2009-03-29 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* examples/nsh:  A debug option was left on that can (and does) cause
	  infinite loops and stack overflows.
	* net/uip: Correct calculation of checksum on ICMP ping response.
	* examples/dchpd: Added a tiny DHCP server example
	* net/uip: Correct UDP bind behavior.  It should select a valid port number
	  if it receives a port number of zero.
	* netutils/dhcpd:  Corrrect for ZDS compiler.  Fix issue with re-use of a
	  port number. Fixed a number of broadcast-related problems.
	* eZ80Acclaim!: Add a tiny webserver configuration
	* eZ80Acclaim!: Fixed an important bug in the EMAC Tx timeout logic. It was
	  always timing out when the load was heavy and worse, for some reason,
	  resetting the Tx function caused unexpected registers to be reset in
	  the Rcv function was well.
	* Z80: Patch incorported: "[2696648] Z80: interrupt flag stored in parity bit"
	  (submitted by JPelletier).  The is the same fix that was needed for the
	  eZ80 and fixed in 0.4.2.
	* netutils: Added logic to support a simple wget() function
	* examples/wget: Added a test for wget() (untested -- see NOTE)
	* lib/strncasecmp: Fix cut'n'paste error in function name.
	* NSH: Added wget command (untested -- see NOTE).
	* examples/sendmail: A simple sendmail example (untested -- see NOTE)

	NOTE: Features related to wget and sendmail are not tested on the target platform
	in this release and, hence, most likely have problems.	I don't have the correct network
	setup to perform that testing now (I'm in a hotel).

0.4.5 2009-04-19 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* Add an enumeration argument to the SPI chip select and status methods so
	  that the interface can handle more than one device.
	* eZ80Acclaim!: Add a generic SPI driver for all eZ80 boards.
	* Add a setmode() method to the SPI interface to handle parts with differing
	  mode requirements.
	* include/nuttx/i2c.h: Defined a standard I2C interface
	* eZ80Acclaim!: Add an I2C driver.
	* eZ8Encore!: Add an I2C driver.
	* Add support for the Freescale i.MX1/L architecture and a configuration for
	  the Freescale MX1ADS development board.
	* examples/helloxx: Added a simple C++ hello world example
	* include/css: Added std header files
	* libxx: New C++-only directory provides support for minimal C++ applications

0.4.6 2009-05-19 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* Change SPI interface so that is can accomodate interfaces where the
	  number of bits per word is greater an 8 (such as with many 9-bit display
	  interfaces). -- this might have broken a few things which will need to
	  be retested!
	* arch/arm/src/imx: Added i.MX SPI driver
	* SPI: Add a method to set the number of bits per word.  Also add an
	  alternative interface for so that (eventually) I can phase the sndblock
	  and recvblock methods and replace them with a single exchange method
	* Build:  objcopy fails with toolchains that use newer GCC and binutils.  The
	  following arguments need to be included in the objcopy command line "-R .note
	  -R .note.gnu.build-id -R .comment"  This has been fixed in arch/arm/src/Makefile,
	  but other architectures may have the same problem.  Thanks to Dave Marples
	  for verifying this.
	* configs/eagle100/ostest: Added support for the MicroMint Eagle100 board. 
	  This board has a Luminary LM3S6918 Cortex-M3. Added a configuration to build
	  examples/ostest.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc214x: Add configuration option to enable fast GPIO (vs.
	  legacy, "slow" GPIO) for LPC214x.
	* arch/arm: Restructured the arch/arm directory structure to better support ARM
	  and Cortex-M3.
	* sched/: pthread_create() must return a (non-negated) errno value on failure.
	* configs/eagle100/nsh: Add a NuttShell (NSH) configuration for the Eagle-100

0.4.7 2009-05-29 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* arch/arm/src/lm3s: Added an Ethernet driver for the LM3S6918
	* configs/eagle100/nettest: Added an examples/nettest configuration for the
	  Micromint Eagle100 board.
	* Documentation/NuttxPortingGuide.html: Added a section on NuttX device drivers.
	* configs/eagle100/httpd: Added an examples/uip configuration for the
	  Micromint Eagle100 board.
	* arch/arm/src/lm3s: Added an SSI driver for the LM3S6918
	* examples/nsh: Added MMC/SD support for the LM3S6918
	* arch/arm/src/lm3s: Fix logic for setting and clearing output GPIOs (critical
	  fix!).
	* drivers/mmcsd: Found numerous errors in current MMC/SD SPI driver.  Bad frequency
	  calculation based on CSD settings, inappropriate timeouts, odd code that looks like
	  a bad search and replace.  Also needs support for SDHC ver 2.x.  New MMC/SD is
	  largely redesigned and probably non-functional in the first check-in.
	* drivers/mmcsd: Changes verified on 4Gb Kingston microSHDC card and on a 2Gb
	  SanDisk microSDC card on the Eagle100 platform.
	* fs/fat: With the 4Gb card, the first tests of FAT32 were (finally) performed.
	  Found and corrected a problem that prevented use of FAT32: It was not updating
	  the sector cache before checking the FAT32 FSINFO sector.
	* configs/eagle100/*/Make.defs:  Added configuration options that should make
	  it possible to build NuttX for the Eagle100 using CodeSourcery 2009q1 toolchain
	  and the devkitARM GNU toolchain.
	* configs/mcu123-lpc214x/src: Corrected some logic in the LPC2148 SPI receive block
	  logic.  Re-verified SDC ver1.x support with 1Gb Toshiba SDC, 1Gb PNY SDC, and
	  4Gb Kingston SDHC.  There are CMD0 issues with the 2Gb SanDisk SDC on this board.
	* fs/fs_mount.c: Corrected error handling that could cause a deadlock on certain
	  mount() failures.

0.4.8 2009-06-13 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* lib/lib_*stream.c: Extend internal stream logic to support incoming streams.
	* arch/arm/src/str71x: Serial output is now correct and timer interrupts are
	  working.	The test at configs/olimex-strp711/ostest passes.  This means that
	  the basic STR-P711 port is complete.
	* configs/olimex-strp711/nsh:  Add and verified a NuttShell (NSH) configuration
	  for the STR-P711.
	* arch/arm/str71x/str71x_serial.c:	The STR711 interrupt driven serial driver
	  finally works after some extradinary measures to handle missed interrupts.
	  NSH is fully functional on the Olimex STR-P711 board.
	* example/nsh: Moved architecture specific files from NSH directory to board-
	  specific directories.
	* config/olimex-strp711/src/up_nsh.c:  Add an NSH board specific directory for
	  for the Olimex STR7P11 board.
	* Fixed build of LM3X6918 using the CodeSourcery Windows native toolchain.	There
	  were lots of issues with Cygwin paths and Cygwin symbolic links.	These changes
	  may work with the devarmKIT as well, but that remains untested.
	* The NXP LPC2148 and STR711 targets can now also be built using the CodeSourcery
	  or devkitARM Windows native toolchains.

0.4.9 2009-06-26 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* Add strtoll() and strtoull(); Add macros for atol() and atoll().
	* dup() and dup2() will now clone socket descriptors
	* All socket descriptors are now cloned when a new task is started via
	  task_create().
	* Add configuration options to suppress or eliminate cloning of file
	  and/or socket descriptors when a new task is started by task_create():
	  CONFIG_FDCLONE_DISABLE, CONFIG_FDCLONE_STDIO, CONFIG_SDCLONE_DISABLE.
	* Use of C++ reserved word 'private' in C header files causes problems
	  for C++ that include them.
	* Added 'binfmt' support to allow execution of programs in a file system,
	  binding to NuttX symbols. A custom format call NXFLAT is used; this
	  derives from http://xflat.sourceforge.net.  At present is supports on
	  XIP execution from ROMFS file systems.  Initial check-in is untested
	  and probably breaks many builds.
	* examples/lib: Added qsort()
	* examples/nxflat: Added support for symbol tables
	* Correct logic that creates compiler include paths.  On Cygwin, the
	  include paths for Cygwin-based GCC were being converted to windows
	  native paths.  That causes many problems -- breaking dependencies
	  for one.
	* Fixed an important bug in ROMFS.	The initial XIP offset was set
	  incorrectly so if sector zero was read first, there was a bad read.
	  I don't know how it worked before.
	* arch/arm/src/common/up_use_stack.c.  Fixed a fatal stack setup error.
	  This file has been around for a long time, but I don't think it has
	  every been used before (i.e., prior to the NXFLAT logic)

0.4.10 2009-08-08 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* lib/: Added some basic regex-subset, pattern matching functions
	* lib/: Greatly simplified mktime() and gmtime_r().  The Gregorian and
	  Julian time calculations were interesting, but not necessary in the
	  typical embeddd system.
	* sched/: Added gettimeofday().  This implementation is simply a thin
	  wrapper around clock_gettimer().
	* lib/: Add gmtime(), localtime(), and strftime()
	* binfmt/: Add exec().	This is just a wrapper that executes both
	  load_ and exec_module() in a more familiar manner.  It is not consistent
	  with more standard exec() functions, however, because (1) it returns
	  and (2) it requires symbol table arguments.
	* lib/: Add fileno()
	* examples/ostest: Several of the tests used a big, hard-coded stack size
	  when creating test threads (16K stacksize).	The stack size should
	  be controlled by the .config file or the OSTest won't work on platforms
	  with memory constraints.
	* netutils/thttpd: An initial port of Jeff Poskanzer's THTTPD HTTP server.
	  See http://acme.com/software/thttpd/.
	* examples/thttpd: A basic test program for THTTPD
	* configs/eagle100/thttpd: A build configuration for THTTPD on the Micromint
	  Eagle-100 LMS6918 (Cortex-M3) board.
	* configs/ntosd-dm320/thttpd: A build configuration for THTTPD on the Neuros
	  DM320 platform.
	* lib/: Added strstr() and strpbrk().
	* net/recvfrom.c and net/accept(): Sockets now support some non-blocking
	  operations, specifically for (1) TCP/IP read operations when read-ahead
	  buffering is enabled, and (2) TCP/IP accept() operations when TCP/IP
	  connection backlog is enabled.
	* fs/fs_fcntl.c and net/net_vfcntl.c: Minimal support provided for fcntl().
	  It can, at least, be used to mark sockets as blocking or non-blocking.
	* net/net_close.c: Fix bug in close().	If reference count not set to zero
	  then uip_tcpfree() will assert when DEBUG is enabled.
	* net/accept.c: Fix bug in accept().  The logic expected parts of the
	  return address structure to be initialized or it would return an error.

0.4.11 2009-09-16 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* fs/fs_read.c and fs/fs_write.c.  read() and write() to socket is the
	  same as recv() and send() with flags = 0.  Fixed!
	* net/recvfrom.c: Fix errors in return value from non-blocking socket read.
	* lib/lib_strcasecmp.c and lib/lib_strncasecmp.c.  Use of post-incremented
	  argument to macro caused strcasecmp() and strncasecmp() to fail.
	* lib/lib_strstr.c:  Length of substring off by one causes false alarm
	  sub-string matches.
	* arch/arm/src/lm3s/lm3s_ethernet.c: Fix errors in LMS6918 FIFO length
	  handling.  (1) The incorrect size of the Ethernet header was being
	  subtracted on outgoing messages (4 vs 14), which caused outgoing messages to
	  be a little too long.  (2) The size of incoming FIFO messages is 6 bytes
	  larger than it expected (2 for the length and 4 for the FCS).  The unhandled
	  extra two bytes of length cause the driver to sometimes read one too many
	  words from the received FIFO (corrupting the next queued receive packet,
	  if any).
	* net/net_poll.c and net/uip/uip_tcpbacklog.c.	Fixed an important race condition
	  bug in polling for connections.  The logic worked if the poll was inplace
	  before the connection was received; but the poll failed to awaken if the
	  connection was already pending in the backlog when poll() was called.
	* net/net_close.c.	Fixed another important TCP/IP race condition bug:	If
	  the host closes the TCP connection just before the target calls close(), then
	  the close operation may hang indefinitely!
	* net/net_tcppoll.c.  Removed an unnecessary check for outstanding, un-ACKed
	  data.  The NuttX socket layer keeps track of ACKs and doesn't need this check;
	  removing the check should improve write throughput
	* Add DEBUG configuration option to enable debug console output without disabling
	  optimization (and vice versa)
	* Changed lots of occurrences of debug macro dbg() to lldbg().  dbg() uses
	  stdout to output debug data.	That works fine unless (1) the dbg() macro
	  is interrupt logic and the interrupted task has redirected stdout!  Most
	  changes were in uIP.
	* net/uip/uip_tcpinput.c.  Connection reference count was not being set correctly
	  when a socket is created by accepting a new connection.  Since the reference
	  count is bad, such sockets are not successfully duplicated when being passed
	  to new tasks.
	* net/net_clone.c.	Similarly, after a socket is cloned, its reference count
	  was not being initialized.
	* lib/lib_strstr.c.  Improperly incremented pointer could cause comparison
	  failures.
	* net/.  Connection reference count must always be set to zero before calling
	  uip_tcpfree() or it could trigger a DEBUGASSERT that verifies that the
	  reference count is zero before freeing a connection structure.
	* net/uip/uip_listen.c.  uip_accept() consulted the wrong list to find the
	  listener on a socket.  The previous logic worked most of the time, but
	  occasionally picked the wrong listener.
	* net/net_close.c and net/net_sockets.c.  Sockets were not being closed
	  when a task exits.  If many server tasks are created and exit without closing
	  sockets (such as with CGI tasks), then eventually, you will run out of sockets.
	* netutils/thttpd.	Basic functionality of THTTPD is complete.	This includes
	  serving up files from a file system and executing NXFLAT-based CGI programs
	  and pipe the stdout back to the HTTP client.

0.4.12 2009-10-17 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* arch/arm/src/stm32 and configs/stm3210e-eval.  Added basic support for the
	  STMicro STM32, Cortex-M3 MCU.  The specific port is to the STMicro STM3210E-EVAL
	  development board based around the STM32F103ZET6 MCU.
	* configs/stm3210e-eval/RIDE.  Added a basic STMicro RIDE7 project that can be
	  used to perform basic STM32 board bring-up (due to RIDE7 size limitations, it
	  cannot be used for the full NuttX bring-up).
	* configs/stm3210e-eval/ostest.  The STM32 now passes the basic NuttX OS test
	  at examples/ostest.  The rest should be a piece of cake.
	* configs/stm3210e-eval/nsh.  Added NuttShell (NSH) example.
	* configs/stm3210e-eval/src/stm32102e-internal.h.  Fix on-board LED GPIO definitions.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/src/stm32/stm32_dma.c.  Added DMA channel support for the STM32
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/src/stm32/stm32_spi.c.  Added a DMA-based SPI driver for the STM32.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/src/stm32/stm32_serial.c.	Finished interrupt-driven,
	  USART console driver.  This makes NSH work perfectly.
	* Things left to do for the STM32 deferred to the 0.4.13 release:  USB device driver,
	  LCD driver and NX bringup on the eval board's display and MicroSD support.  An SPI
	  driver was included in the 0.4.12 release, but is not yet tested.

0.4.13 2009-11-04 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* include/nuttx/mtd.h.	Added a simple interface definition to support some
	  FLASH, EEPROM, NVRAM, etc. devices.
	* driver/mtd/m25px.c.  Added a driver for SPI based FLASH parts M25P64 and M25P128.
	* configs/stm3210e-eval/usbserial.	Add a USB serial configuration for the STM32.
	  Depends on the STM32 USB driver.
	* arch/arm/src/cortexm3/up_switchcontext.S & up_svccall.c.	Made an improvement
	  to context switching.  There are two types of context switches:  interrupt
	  context switches and background/user context switches.  This change should
	  improve the performance of those background/user context switches by a factor
	  of about two.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/: fix several typos in the serial logic.	It turns out
	  that these typose don't make any difference as long as you use only one
	  serial port and all uarts are configured the same.  But the typos are bugs
	  waiting to happen in any other configuration.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/: You have to configure CTS/RTS function pins for USART
	  2 and USART 3 even if you are not using flow control.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_usbdev.c: Added a USB device-side driver for the
	  STM32.  NOTE: This is an early release of the USB driver.  There is at least
	  one known issue. The examples/usbserial test only executes correctly under
	  certain conditions (see the full bug description in the TODO list).
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_rcc.c: Fixed an error in clock initialization.
	  On some boards (none of mine), the HSE (high speed external clock) delay
	  loop times out if the optimization level is high. The STM32 then falls
	  back to the HSI (internal clock), and the system clock is too slow by a
	  factor of 11.1%.	This was fixed by simply add the volatile storage class
	  to the timeout loop counter
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_irq.c: Fixed a critical bug in the interrupt
	  control logic.  The wrong register was being used for interrupts in a
	  certain range.  Worked fine until you try to use an interrupt in that
	  range!

4.14 2009-12-02 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_gpio.c: Add support for configure an input GPIO
	  to generate an EXTI interrupt.
	* config/stm3210e-eval/src/up_buttons.c: Add support for on-board buttons.
	* include/nuttx/rwbuffer.h: Add generic support for read-ahead buffering
	  and write buffering that can be used in any block driver.
	* include/nuttx/wqueue.h: Added a generic worker thread that can used to
	  defer processing from an interrupt to a task.
	* include/nuttx/sdio.h: Defines a generic SD/SDIO interface can can be
	  bound to a MMC/SD driver to provide SDIO-based MMC/SD support.
	* drivers/mmcsd/mmcsd_sdio.c: Provides an SDIO-based MMC/SD driver.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_sdio.c: Provides an STM32 implementation of
	  the SDIO interface defined in include/nuttx/sdio.h.
	* fs/fs_mount.c: Correct error handling logic.  If the bind() method
	  fails, then a reserved node is left in the tree.	This causes subsequent
	  attempts to mount at the location to fail (reporting that the node
	  already exists).	This is a problem for block drivers for removable
	  media: The bind method could fail repeatedly until media is inserted.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/chip.h & stm32_dma.c: Fixed several definitions
	  that can cause compilation errors when DMA2 is enabled.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_dma.c: Integrated and debugged STM32 DMA
	  functionality that was added in 0.4.12.
	* configs/stm3210e-eval/usbstorage: Add a configuration to exercise
	  the STM32 with the USB mass storage device class example
	  (examples/usbstorage).
	* configs/mcu123-lpc214x/up_usbstrg: Move LPC-specific code from
	  examples/usbstorage to configs/mcu123-lpc214x.
	* configs/stm321e-eval/up_usbstrg: Add STM32-specific logic for the
	  examples/usbstorage test.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_usbdev.c: Fix bugs in STM32 USB device-side
	  driver:  (1) Need to disconnect after reset received, (2) Status setup
	  to recover from stall on TX endpoint.

5.0 2009-12-21 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* arch/hc: Adding framework to support m68hc11/12
	* configs/demo9s12ne64: Configuration to support Freescale DEMO9S12NE64
	  development board (MC9S12NE64 m68hcs12 processor).
	* drivers/mtd/ftl.c: A FLASH translation layer (FTL) has been implemented.
	  This layer will convert a FLASH MTD interface into a block driver that
	  can be used with any file system.  Good performance of this layer will
	  depend upon functioning write buffer support!
	  NOTE: FTL support is untested as of the initial check-in.
	* Numerous minor changes for m68hc12 to eliminate compilation errors and
	  warnings due to the fact that it uses 16-bit integer types and for casts
	  between uint32 (32-bits) and an mc68hc12 pointer (16-bits).
	* sys/types:  Size of off_t and blkcnt_t should not depend on size of
	  int in the architecture;  Removed non-standard type STATUS
	* include/: Added header files stdint.h, stdbool.h, cxx/cstdint, and
	  cxx/cstdbool
	* Changed ALL references to non-standard fixed-size types (like uint32,
	  ubyte, etc.) to standard types (like uint32_t, uint8_t, etc.) from
	  stdint.h.  Use type bool and {true, false} from stdbool.  This effected
	  most of the files in the system!  Almost all configurations have been
	  re-built and many have been re-verified in order to get confidence in
	  these changes.
	* graphics/ and examples/nx: Fix numerous build errors that have been
	  introduced lately.  NXGL has suffered some bit-rot from not being used
	  in some of the most recent ports.
	* The misc/pascal NuttX add-on package has been updated to use the new
	  standard types from stdint.h and stdbool.h and re-integrated with NuttX.
	  The released pascal-2.0 will be the first version that contains the
	  compatible changes.
	* arch/arm/src/lm3s/lm3s_ethernet.c: Fixed an important bug in the LM3S
	  Ethernet driver:  If full packet is received, the packet-too-big check
	  will fail because it needs to subtract 6 from the packet size (to
	  account for the 2-byte packet length and the 4-byte packet FCS in the
	  FIFO).
	* net/accept.c: Fixed a bad assertion (only happens when debug is enabled).
	* net/send.c net/uip/uip_tcpseqno.c: Fixed a critical error in the TCP/IP
	  logic.  The NuttX port of uIP imcludes logic to send data ahead without
	  waiting for ACKs from the recipient; this greatly improves throughput.
	  However, the packet sequence number was not being updated correctly and,
	  as a result, packets were not be ACKed by the recipient and transfers
	  would sometimes stall.  This is a very important bug fix (in fact, I
	  don't understand how TCP/IP worked at all without this fix???)
	* include/nuttx/arch.h and arch/*/common/up_udelay.c: Change argument
	  of up_udelay() to type useconds_t to avoid warnings when sizeof(int)
	  is 16-bits.
	* drivers/mmcsd/*: Add casts in constant expressions to avoid warnings
	  when sizeof(int) is 16-bits.

5.1 2010-01-30 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* arch/arm/src/lpc313x and arch/arm/include/lpc313x: Added framework
	  to support the NXP LPC3131.
	* Add configs/ea3131.  The LPC3131 port for the Embedded Artist EA3131
	  (LPC3131) is code complete and waiting for me to get hardware in
	  hand.
	* arch/arm/src/sam3u, arch/arm/include/sam3u, and configs/sam3u-ek -
	  Added the basic framework needed to begin a port for the SAM3U-EK
	  development board.
	* lib/lib_crc32.c: Add CRC32 logic by Gary S. Brown to lib/.  This is
	  the larger (but faster) table look-up version of the CRC32 algorithm.
	* confgs/ea3131/tools: Added a tool to create a image suitable for
	  use with the LPC313x bootloader.
	* configs/sam3u-3k/ostest: Completed verification of the basic NuttX
	  OS test for the SAM3U.
	* arch/arm/src/common/up_createstack: stack was always been cleared
	  when it was allocated.  This is a good feature for monitoring the 
	  stack during debug, but really hurts thread start-up performance.
	  Clearing is now done if CONFIG_DEBUG=y only.  Changes was only made
	  for arm, but really should be made for all architectures.
	* configs/sam3u/nsh: Added NSH configuration for SAM3U

5.2 2010-03-18 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* arch/arm/src/sam3u/sam3u_pio.c: Fix an address calculation error
	  that caused ports B & C to get mapped to the PIOA base address.
	  This is an important bugfix! (a patch is available)
	* arch/arm/src/lpc313x/lpc313x_boot.c: Fix an error in the vector
	  initialization was causing a memory fault.
	* lib/lib_strtod.c: Add strtod()
	* lpc3131/ea3131: Several bring fixes submitted by David Hewson.  The
	  lpc3131 is almost there!  Thanks David!
	* arch/arm/src/arm/up_head.S: Corrected backward conditional compilation
	  that selects if vectors are located at 0x0000:0000 or 0xffff:f000.
	  This fixes the last show stopper bug in the lpc313x bring-up.
	* configs/ea3131/nsh: Added a NuttShell (NSH) configuration for the
	  EA3131.

5.3 2010-04-11 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* arch/arm/src/lpc313x/lpc313x_usbdev.c: USB driver for the LPC313x
	  contributed by David Hewson.
	* configs/ea3131/src/up_ubstrgc.c, configs/ea3131/usbserial,
	  configs/ea3131/usbstorage: USB storage and USB serial example support
	  contributed by David Hewson.
	* Several important compilation error fixes in lpc313x and (dualspeed) USB
	  code also contributed by David Hewson.
	* arch/arm/src/sam3u/sam3u_dmac.c: DMA support for the AT90SAM3U.
	* arch/arm/src/sam3u/sam3u_hsmci.c: SD memory card support for AT90SAM3U
	  (Neither the DMA nor the HSMCI driver are functional on the initial checkin).
	* drivers/usbdev: Several important fixes to the USB mass storage driver
	  submitted by David Hewson.
	* configs/olimex-lpc2378, arch/arm/include/lpc2378, and arch/arm/src/lpc2378 -
	  Basic port of the NXP 2378 on the Olimex board contributed by
	  Rommel Marcelo.
	* arch/arm/src/sam3u/sam3u_internal.h: Fixed a critical bug in the AT91SAM3U
	  PIO decoding.  No PIOs greater than 15 could be used on any port!  Obviously,
	  no one has been using this port.

5.4 2010-04-23 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* include/nuttx/lcd.h: Defines an LCD interface.
	* graphics/nxglib/fb and lcd: Support LCD and framebuffer rasterizers for NX.
	* configs/sam3u-ek/src/up_lcd.c: LCD driver for LCD on SAM3U-EK development
	  board.
	* configs/sam3u-ek/nx: NX graphics configuration for the SAM3U-EK

5.5 2010-05-09 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* drivers/net/enc28j60.c: Microchip ENC28J60 SPI Ethernet chip driver.
	  (untested on original check-in).
	* configs/olimex-str7p11/nettest: examples/nettest configuration using
	  the ENC28J60 driver on the Olimex STMicro STR-P711.
	  (unverified on original check-in)
	* configs/olimex-str7p11/src/up_enc28j60.c: Add ENC28J60 initialization
	  logic.
	* configs/olimex-str7p11/src/up_spi.c: Fixed some bugs; added support
	  for ENC28J60.
	* arch/arm/src/str7x/str7x_xti.c: Add basic XTI support (external
	  interrupts).
	* arch/arm/src/lm3s and arch/arm/include/lm3s: Add definitions for
	  LM3S6965
	* configs/lm3s6965-ek: Add configuration for Stellaris LM3S6965
	  Evaluation Kit (including basic examples/ostest configuration)
	* lib/lib_dtoa.c and lib/lib_dtoa.c: printf will not print floating
	  point values if you select CONFIG_LIBC_FLOATINGPOINT in your
	  configuration file.  Contributed by Yolande Cates.  NOTE:  these
	  floating point operations have not been well tested and may not
	  be portable to all floating point implementations.
	* configs/lm3s6965-ek/nsh: Added NuttShell (NSH) configuration for
	  the LM3S6965 Evaluation Kit.  Includes both serial and telnet
	  interfaces.
	* net/net_close.c: Correct a UDP reference counting error

5.6 2010-06-05 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* drivers/lcd/p14201.c: Driver for RiT P14201 series 128x96 4-bit OLED.
	* configs/lm3s6965-ek/nx: NX graphics configuration for the LM3S6965
	  Ethernet Evaluation Kit.
	* graphics/: Numerous fixes to get the P14201 4-bpp grayscale display
	  working (there may still be some minor issues .. see the TODO list).
	* arch/arm/include/lpc17xx and arch/arm/src/lpc17xxx: Began port for
	  NXP LPC1768.  As of the 5.6 release, there is a complete set of
	  LPC17xx header files defining all bits in all LPC17xx registers,
	  but little else (I still do not have hardware in hand).
	* drivers/mtd/m25px.c: Add support for M25P1 flash part (See NOTE)
	* include/nuttx/i2c.h: Extended I2C interface definition to handle
	  multiple transfers (See NOTE).
	* include/nuttx/usbdev.h: Corrected an important macro definition
	  needed to correctly handle USB null packet transfers (See NOTE).
	* arch/arm/src/lpc313x: New drivers: I2C and SPI.  Plus several
	  important LPC313x USB bug fixes (See NOTE).

	NOTE: Contributed by David Hewson.

5.7 2010-06-22 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* configs/nucleus2g: Add ostest configuration for the Nucleus 2G
	  LPC1768 board from 2G Engineering (http://www.2g-eng.com/)
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx: Added basic LPC17xx boot-up logic,
	  interrupt handling, and GPIO configuration.
	* configs/nucleus2g/ostest: Completed bring-up of LPC1768 on
	  the Nucleus2G board using the examples/ostest
	* configs/nucleus2g/nsh: Added and verified a NuttShell (NSH)
	  configuration for the LPC1768 on the Nucleus2G board.

5.8 2010-07-18 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* configs/nucleus2g/src/up_nsh.c and up_ssp.c: Add support
	  for SPI-based MMC/SD cards and integrate into the NSH example.
	* arch/arm/src/lm3s/lm3s_vectors.S: Correct vectors for GPIOC & D
	  interrupts.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lp17_clockconfig.c: Power was not being
	  provided to GPIO module.  This is a critical bugfix!
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_serial.c: Improved logic to handle
	  missed TX interrupts.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_ssp.c: Fix a hard fault during SSP
	  initialization.
	* configs/nucleus2g/src/up_led.c: Change how LEDs are controlled
	  so that they can be used both for NuttX instrumentation and
	  by application software.
	* include/net/uip/igmp.h and uip-igmp.h: Add header files ini
	  preparation for NuttX IGMP support
	* net/uip/uip_igmp*.c: Add IGMP support (untested on initial
	  checkin).
	* examples/igmp: Add a trivial test for IGMP (much more is needed)
	* configs/nucleus2g/usbserial and usbstorage: Add USB configurations
	  for testing purposes.
	* arch/arm/src/common/up_internal.h, cortexm3/up_assert.c,
	  */*_vectors.S: Correct compilations errors when CONFIG_ARCH_INTERRUPTSTACK
	  is enabled (feature still not tested)

5.9 2010-08-25 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* examples/nsh/nsh_telnetd.c: Fix compilation errors that happen
	  when both DHCPC and TELNETD are enabled in the Nuttshell.
	* graphics/nxglib/fb/nxglib_moverectangle.c: Fix a logic error
	  that caused an uninitialized variable warning.  I still don't 
	  have a test to prove that the changes are correct.
	* configs/olimex-lpc2378: Add support for the CodeSourcery toolchain
	  under Linux (contributed by Alan Carvalho de Assis).
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_gpio.c: Fix an important GPIO configuration
	  bug:  When attempting to set no pull-up or pull-down (floating),
	  it would, instead, select pull-down.
	* arch/arm/src/lm3s/lm3s_gpioirq.c: Fix warning for returning a value
	  from functions returning void (contributed by Tiago Maluta).
	* netutils/dhcpc/dhcpc.c: lease_time was not in host order
	* examples/uip/main.c: if DHCPC is selected, this example now shows
	  the assigned IP address.
	* arch/arm/src/lm3s and arch/arm/include/lm3s: Definitions for the
	  TI LM3S9B96 contributed by Tiago Maluta.
	* arch/arm/src/lm3s/lm3s_gioirq.c: Fix a logic error in the address
	  table lookup.
	* arch/arm/src/lm3s/lm3s_gioirq.c: Also needs to enable the global
	  GPIO interrupts.
	* arch/arm/src/lm3s/lm3s_internal.h and lm3s_gpio.c: Fixed the encoding
	  of GPIO port number that limited support for GPIO ports to 8
	* sched/pg_*.c and *.c and include/nuttx/page.h: Implemented the
	  common, core logic for on-demand paging. See
	  http://www.nuttx.org/NuttXDemandPaging.html for details.
	* drivers/usbdev/usbdev_serial.c: Correct compilation errors that
	  occur if CONFIG_USBDEV_DUALSPEED is selected.
	* configs/ea3131/pgnsh: Add an NSH configuration with on-demand paging
	  enabled.  This is not expected to be a functionality configuration (at
	  least not yet); it was created in order to debug the on-demand paging
	  feature.
	* configs/ntosd-dm320/*/Make.defs: Codesourcery and devkitARM toolchains
	  now supported for the Neuros OSD.
	* configs/ntosd-dm320 and arch/arm/src/dm320: Add support for the
	  Neuros production OSD (changes contributed by bf.nuttx).

5.10 2010-09-07 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* configs/ea3131/locked: Create logic to support a two pass build
	  process:  The first pass forces critical logic into the locked text
	  region, the second pass builds the NuttX executable more-or-less as
	  normal.
	* Makefile, arch/arm/src/Makefile, configs/ea3131: Add logic to
	  support a two-pass final link.  This logic is only in place in
	  the arch/arm/src/Makefile for now.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_internal.h: Add missing parentheses in
	  macros definitions (patch submitted by Tiago Maluta).
	* Documents/NuttxPortingGuide.html, configs/README.txt, etc. -
	  Replaced CONFIG_EXAMPLE with CONFIG_APP_DIR (see documents for
	  desciption).  This allows NuttX application code to be built
	  outside of the examples/ directory.

	  For people who have their own configurations and/or Makefiles,
	  you will need to make a couple of changes:

	  - Replace all occurrences of CONFIG_EXAMPLE=foobar with
	    CONFIG_APP_DIR=examples/foobar in all of the configuration
	    files.
	  - Replace any occurrences of examples/$(CONFIG_EXAMPLE) with
	    $(CONFIG_APP_DIR)
	  - Replace any occurrences of lib$(CONFIG_EXAMPLE)$(LIBEXT)
	    with libapp$(LIBEXT) in your Makefiles.
	  - Check any other occurrences of CONFIG_EXAMPLE.

	* arch/arm/src/lpc313x/lpc313x_spi.c: Fix compilation error when
	  when CONFIG_DEBUG is enabled.
	* arch/arm/src/lm3s and arch/arm/include/lm3s: Support for the
	  lm3s8962 contributed by Larry Arnold.
	* configs/lm328962-ek: Support for the TI/Stellaris EKC-LM3S8962
	  board (also contributed by Larry Arnold).
	* arch/arm/src/lpc313x/lpc313x_boot.c: The call to lpc313x_boardinitialized()
	  should not be conditioned on CONFIG_ARCH_LEDs being defined!
	* arch/arm/src/lpc313x/: APB0 and APB1 cannot lie in different
	  sections; they are too close together.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc313x/lpc13x_boot.c: Resetting all of the clocking
	  had a side effect of wiping out the first 6 words of memory where the
	  interrupt vectors are located (and also not resetting the fractional
	  dividers).  This is not usually noticeable because the IRQ vectors
	  are after this point, but really causes problems if you want to handle
	  data and prefectch aborts which are within this zeroed region.

5.11 2010-10-01 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* configs/ea3131/src/up_fillpage.c: Added new configuration item
	  CONFIG_PAGING_BINPATH.  If CONFIG_PAGING_BINPATH is defined, then it
	  is the full path to a file on a mounted file system that contains
	  a binary image of the NuttX executable.  Pages will be filled by
	  reading from offsets into this file that correspond to virtual
	  fault addresses.  up_fillpage.c implements logic to perform page
	  files using the CONFIG_PAGING_BINPATH file.
	* configs/mbed: Add configuration to support the mbed.org LPC1768
	  board (Contributed by Dave Marples).
	* sched/sem_wait.c and sem_waitirq.c: Eliminate a race condition
	  that can occur when a semaphore wait is interrupt by a signal.
	  (see email thread: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/nuttx/message/530)
	* drivers/mtd/at45db.c: Add a driver for the Atmel AT45DB161D 4Mbit
	  SPI FLASH part (untested on initial check-in).
	* arch/arm/src/lm3s and arch/arm/include/lm3s: Corrections for the
	  lm3s8962 port contributed by Larry Arnold.  That port is purported
	  to work correctly with these changes in place.
	* examples/ostest/prioinherit.c: Need to reinitialize globals if
	  test is ran repeatedly in a loop.
	* configs/ez80f910200zco: Updated to used ZDS-II 4.11.1

5.12 2010-10-26 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* arch/avr: Add a place to support AVR family processors.
	* arch/avr/include/avr32 and arch/avr/src/avr32: Add support for AVR32
	  (all of the AVR32 is a work in progress).
	* arch/avr/include/at32uc3 and arch/avr/src/at32uc3: Add support
	  for the AVR32 UC3A/B family of AVR32 MCUs.
	* confgs/avr32dev1: Add support for the Atmel AVR32DEV1 board featuring
	  the AT32UC3B0256 MCU.  This board is produced by www.mcuzone.com.
	* include/stdlib.h, lib/Makefile, lib/lib_abs.c, lib/lib_labs.c,
	  lib_labs.c, lib_llabs.c, lib_imaxabs.c: Add abs(), labs(), llabs(), and
	  imaxabs().
	* Add include/inttypes.h
	* arch/hc/src/mc9s12ne64: This hcs12 port grew a few more files.  But it
	  is still a long way from complete.
	* arch/*/src/*/*_sigdeliver.c: Fixed a serious error in the signal
	  trampoline logic.  Essentially, interrupts are re-enabled while the
	  signal handler executes, but the logic to re-disable the interrupts
	  before returning from the signal handler trampoline was missing.  Under
	  certain circumstances, this can cause stack corruption.  This was
	  discovered by David Hewson on an ARM9 platform, but since the code
	  has been leveraged, the bug has been propogated from ARM to Cortex-M3,
	  AVR32, M16C, SH1, ZNEO, eZ80, Z8, and Z80 -- almost every architecture.
	  The correction has been incorporated for all architectures but only
	  verified on a few.

5.13 2010-11-09 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* lib/lib_strnlen.c: Added POSIX 2008 strnlen() function.  Contributed
	  by Michael Hrabanek.
	* Fix wild, consistent naming error.  For some reason, I called the at32uc3*
	  parts at91uc* everywhere.  Fixed by changing lots of files and directories.
	* configs/avr32dev1/ostest: The AVR32 port now successfully passes the
	  examples/ostest.  We have a good AVR32 port!
	* configs/avr32dev1/nsh: Added a configuration to support the NuttShell
	  (NSH). As of this writing, here is a problem receiving serial data (this
	  is, very likely, my hardware setup).
	* lib/lib_open.c: Fix an error in fdopen when a valid file desciptor does
	  not refer to an open file.
	* configs/olimex-lpc1766stk: Add support for the Olimex LPC1766-STK
	  development board.  The OS test and NSH configurations (only) have been
	  verified.

5.14 2010-11-27 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* configs/olimex-lpc1766stk/nettest: Add examples/nettest configuration to
	  verify the LPC17xx Ethernet driver currently under development.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17xx_ethernet.c/.h: Began development of
	  the LPC17xx Ethernet driver.  Driver in CVS functional after 2010-11-23.
	* sched/timer_settime.c: Fix an error in set-up of a one-shot POSIX timer.  It
	  was using the repititive timer value (which is zero in the one-shot case),
	  always resulting in a 10Ms timer!  Found and fixed by Wilton Tong.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_vector.S, stm32/stm32_vector.S, lm3s/lm3s_vector.S,
	  sam3u/sam3u_vector.S: Fixed a hard fault problem that can occur if certain
	  types of interrupts are pending at the time another interrupt returns
	  (SYSTICK).  This has not been verified on all plaforms, but is a critical
	  fixed that is needed by all Cortex-M3 NuttX users.
	* configs/olimex-lpc1766stk/thttpd: Add a THTTPD configuration for the
	  Olimex LPC2766-STK board. Verified successfully.
	* net/uip/uip_tcpappsend.c: Correct an important logic bug in some uIP state
	  data the is used to manage retransmissions.  The uIP logic was incompatible
	  with the retransmission logic of net/send.c in one place.  The final error
	  was that the final packet in a sequence of packets was too large!  In the
	  THTTPD example, this would leave some garbage at the bottom of the display
	  (or worse).  I don't know why I haven't see this bug before???
	* net/uip/uip_tcpinput.c: The change to uip_tcpappsend.c unmasked an
	  additional error in the TCP sequence number handling.  This sympom was that
	  the send() function would hang with outstanding, unacknowledged data (with
	  no re-transmit requests).  The was due to differences in sequence number
	  handling in send() and in uip_tcpinput.c; uip_tcpinput.c thought (incorrectly)
	  that all of the bytes were acknowledged; send.c knew that they were not.

5.15 2010-12-12 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* net/uip/uip_tcpaddsend.c and net/send.c: Another place where the TCP sequence
	  number problem "fixed" in 5.14 might occur.
	* net/send.c: Check if the destination IP address is in the ARP table.  If
	  not, then don't consider the packet sent.  It won't be, an ARP packet will go
	  out instead.  This improves behavior, for example, on the first GET request
	  from a browser.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_emacram.h and lpc17_allocateheap.c: The Ethernet
	  logic was using all of AHB SRAM Bank0 for Ethernet packet buffers (16K).  An
	  option was added to limit the amount of SRAM used for packet buffering and to
	  re-use any extra Bank0 memory for heap.  configs/olimex-lpc1766stk/nettest
	  now uses only 8K at the beginning of Bank0; the 8K at the end of Bank0 is
	  included in the heap
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_ssp.c: Fix compilation errors when SSP1 is
	  selected.
	* configs/olimex-lpc1766stk/nsh: Enable network and SD/MMC card support in
	  NSH.  Networking and telnetd interface as well as SPI-based microSD are
	  now functional.
	* examples/nsh/nsh_netinit.c: Fix NSH bug.  If CONFIG_NET is selected, but
	  CONFIG_EXAMPLES_NSH_TELNETD is not selected, then the network is never
	  initialized and bad things happen if you try to ping.
	* drivers/lcd: Add header files for the Phillips PCF8833 LCD controller and
	  for the Epson S1D15G10 LCD controller.  A driver for the Nokia 6100 LCD is
	  coming.
	* include/nuttx/spi.h and almost all other SPI files: Added an optional
	  cmddata() method to the SPI interface.  Some devices require an additional
	  out-of-band bit to specify if the next word sent to the device is a command
	  or data. This is typical, for example, in "9-bit" displays where the 9th bit
	  is the CMD/DATA bit. The cmddata method provides selection of command or data.
	* drivers/lcd/p14201.c: Now uses the cmddata() method of the SPI interface.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_usbdev.c: LPC17xx USB driver now appears to
	  to be fully functional.  examples/usbstorage configuration verified (the
	  examples/usbserial configuration is untested).
	* drivers/usbdev/usbserial.c and usbstorage.c: All USB class drivers need
	  to call DEV_CONNECT() when they are ready to be enumerated.  That is,
	  (1) initially when bound to the USB driver, and (2) after a USB reset.
	* drivers/lcd/nokia6100.c: A driver for the Nokia 6100 LCD.  This driver
	  has not be verified as of the initial check-in.
	* configs/olimex-lpc1766stk/nx: A NX graphics configuration for the Olimex
	  LPC1766-STK board using the Nokia 6100 LCD driver.  This configuration has
	  not been verified as of the initial check-in.
	* include/nuttx/spi.h: the SPI_SETBITS macro was calling the setmode method.
	  This is a very important bug-fix in some usages.

5.16 2011-01-10 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* include/nuttx/usb: Created new directory.  Moved all usb-related header
	  files to this new directory.  Created a skeleton for a new USB host header
	  file
	* drivers/usbhost: Add USB host "registry" where connect devices can be
	  matched with the correct USB class driver.
	* arc/arc/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_usbhost.c: Add a simple USB host driver for
	  the NXP lpc17xx.
	* drivers/usbhost: Add generic USB device enumeration logic.
	* drivers/usbhost: Add a USB host class driver for the (Bulk-Only) USB
	  Mass Storage Class.

5.17 2011-01-19 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* include/nuttx/usb: rename usb_storage.h to storage.h.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_usbhost.c: Add support for low-speed devices.
	* drivers/usbhost/usbhost_skeleton.c: Template for new class drivers
	* include/nuttx/usb/hid.h and drivers/usbhost/usbhost_hidkbd.c: New
	  files for HID keyboard support.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_usbhost.c: Will now handle multiple
	  concurrent transfers on different endpoints (still only one TD per
	  endpoint).  All methods are protected from re-entrancy; lots of re-
	  structuring in preparation for interrupt endpoint support.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_usbhost.c: Add support for periodic
	  interrupt transfers.
	* examples/hidkbd: Added a simple test for the USB host HID keyboard
	  class driver.
	* configs/olimex-lpc1766stk/hidkbd: Added a configuration to build the
	  USB host HID keyboard class driver test for the LPC17xx.
	* Ran the tool CppCheck (http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/cppcheck) and
	  fixed several errors in the code identified by the tool.

5.18 2011-02-27 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* Incorporate several uIP patches from http://gitweb.aeruder.net/?p=uip.git;a=summary.
	  - Lost SYNACK causes connection reset
	  - Fix missing UDP stats for sent/received packets
	  - Added support for Cygwin as development/test platform.
	* configs/demo9s12ne64: Integrate new buildroot-1.9 m8s12x toolchain.
	* 'uname -o' is used throughout the build logic in bash scripts and also in
	  Make.defs files in order to distinguish between Cygwin and Linux.  However,
	  the -o option is not standard and is not supported under, for example, OS-X or
	  Solaris.  This was solved by changing all 'uname -o' references to the more
	  complex:  'uname -o 2>/dev/null || echo "Other"'
	* drivers/usbhost/usbhost_enumerate.c: Add logic to get the VID and PID.  This
	  is necessary in order to support vendor-specific USB devices.
	* examples/wlan, configs/olimex-lpc1766stk/wlan, drivers/usbhost/usbhost_rtl8187.c,
	  Add infrastructure to support RTL18187 wireless USB.
	* configs/nucleus2g: backed out USB host changes... wrong board.
	* Renamed arc/hc/include/mc9s12ne64 and src/mc9s12ne64 to m9s12.  That name is
	  shorter and more general.
	* The NuttX repository has been converted to SVN and can now be found here
	  http://svn.code.sf.net/p/nuttx/code/trunk/
	* configs/mbed/hidkbd: Added USB host support for the mbed LPC1768 board; add
	  a USB host HID keyboard configuraion.
	* drivers/usbhost/hid_parser.c: Leverages the LUFA HID parser written by
	  Dean Camera.
	* examples/nsh: Correct an usage of getopt(): If you stop calling getopt()
	  before all parameters are parsed, you can leave getopt() in a strange state.
	* include/nuttx/fb.h: Restore missing RGB type that was accidentally removed
	  when Nokia 6100 support was added.
	* Rename arch/pjrc-8051 to arch/8051
	* configs/ne64badge: Add a configuration for the Future Electronics Group
	  NE64 Badge development board (Freescale MC9S12NE64)
	* Changes contributed by Uros Platise:
	  - Add support for the STM32F103RET6
	  - configs/vsn: Support for the ISOTEL NetClamps VSN V1.2 ready2go sensor
	    network platform
	* arch/hc, configs/ne64badge: Development is complete for the Freescale
	  mc9s12ne64 on the Future Electronics Group NE64 /PoE Badge board.  Howeve,
	  this port remains untested until I figure out this BDM / Code Warrior
	  and paged build thing
	* Added a new 'kill' command to NSH that will support sending signals to
	  running NuttX tasks.

5.19 2011-03-12 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* arch/arm/stm32/stm32_idle.c: During idle times, the STM32 now uses the
	  WFI instruction to sleep in a reduced power mode until the next interrupt
	  occurs (Contributed by Uros Platise).
	* NSH: 'mem' command renamed to 'free'.  Output is now more similar to the
	  Linux 'free' command.
	* NSH: Correct a redirection bug in NSH.  The following would not work; it
	  resulted in a hang after the 'cat /dev/fifo':

	    nsh> mkfile /dev/fifo
	    nsh> cd /tmp             # /tmp is a mounted RAM disk
	    nsh> cat /dev/fifo > test.txt &
	    nsh> echo "This is a test" > /dev/fifo

	  The error was caused because (1) there was a path that resulted in stdout
	  being closed (the "hang") and also (2) the 'cat' command was always outputting
	  to stdout, not to the redirected file descriptor.  Now:

	    nsh> cat test.txt
	    This is a test

	* drivers/pipes/pipe_common.c:  Driver open method was not returning an EINTR
	  error when it received a signal.  Instead, it just re-started the wait.  This
	  makes it impossible to kill a background pipe operation from NSH.
	* include/stdint.h: Correct some errors in conditional compilation (submitted
	  by Johannes Hampel).
	* arch/arm/lpc17xx/lp17_idle.c: Uses the same logic as the STM32: uses the
	  WFI instruction to sleep in a reduced power mode until the next interrupt
	  occurs.
	* configs/olimex-lpc1766stk: Added an LED encoded to indicate if the LPC1766
	  is in sleeping.
	* examples/mm: This is a simplified version of the "built-in" memory manager
	  test of mm/mm_test.c.  It is simplified because it does not have access to
	  the internals of the memory manager as does mm/mm_test.c, but it has the
	  advantage that it runs in the actual NuttX tasking environment (the
	  mm/mm_test.c only runs in a PC simulation environment).
	* drivers/mmcsd_sdio.c/h: Several corrections submitted by Uros Platise.
	* arch/x86: Provide support for x86 architectures.  Support for the i486
	  architecture under QEMU is provided under arch/x86/include/i486,
	  arch/x86/include/qemu, arch/x86/src/i486, and arch/x86/src/qemu.
	* configs/qemu-i486: "Board" support configurations for verifying the QEME
	  i486 port.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_spi.c: Correct base address of SPI3 (reported by
	  Uros Platise).
	* drivers/mmcsd/mmcsd_sdio.c: Correct a loop termination condition (also
	  reported by Uros Platise).
	* drivers/mtd/ramtron.c: Driver for SPI-based RAMTRON NVRAM devices FM25V10
	  (and others).  Contributed by Uros Platise.
	* examples/nsh and tools/mkromfsimg.sh: Add support for platform-specific
	  ROMFS-based NSH start-up scripts.
	* drivers/serial/uart_16550.c and include/nuttx/serial/uart_16550.h: Support
	  for a generic 16550 UART.
	* configure/qemu-i486/nsh: QEMU NSH example.
	* ../apps: The apps directory add-on was created by Uros Platise.  It
	  supports a set of end-user applications than can be executed on top of
	  NSH.  Think of it this way:  In a buckled-up embedded application, your
	  end-user programs will probably have their own dedicated start-up logic.
	  But, during development, you might want to have you applications
	  available and executable from the NSH command line.  This apps/ addon
	  (and NSH hooks) was contributed by Uros to accomplish just that.
	* sched/sched_waitpid() and include/sys/wait.h: Provides a simple and
	  very incomplete implementation of waitpid().  waitpid() is only available
	  if CONFIG_SCHED_WAITPID is defined in your configuration file.
	* sched/atexit.c and sched/exit.c: The atexit function is not frequently
	  used.  In order to save a few bytes, it is now conditioned on
	  CONFIG_SCHED_ATEXIT.  It your application is currently using atexit(),
	  you will need to add CONFIG_SCHED_ATEXIT to your configuration file.
	* drivers/net/slip.c: Add a SLIP driver (untested on initial check-in).
	* configs/olimex-lpc1766stk/slip-httpd: An example that uses SLIP to
	  provide a serial-port based THTTPD web server.

6.0 2011-03-21 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* lib/lib_fopen(): fopen() was not returning the correct errno value
	  when the underlying open() failed.
	* include/net/uip/uip-arch.h: The uIP interface has been extended
	  slightly so that drivers can be concurrenly filling and sending
	  packet buffers.  This capability was needed by the SLIP driver.
	* drivers/net/slip.c: Several corrections and some re-design of
	  of the driver.
	* apps/ChangeLog.txt: the apps/ directory now has its own ChangeLog.
	* configs/vsn:
	  - IDLE LED blinking fix
	  - Added board power off function
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_gpio.c and stm32_internal.h: Fixed
	  PullUp/Down Input Configuration.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_serial.h: Now supports Auto-RTS and
	  Auto-CTS modes.  This is needed to support SLIP.
	* drivers/net/slip.c: SLIP is now basically functional on the
	  LPC17xx with some caveats as described in the TODO list under
	  LPC17xx.
	* arch/x86/include/i486/irq.h: Fix irqrestore() macro... it was not
	  correctly re-enabling interrupts.
	* arch/x86/src: Fix numerous problems with i486/QEMU context
	  switching.  Basically, the logic was missing the cases to handle
	  the differing stack frames when a priority change occurs and when
	  no priority change occurs.
	* configs/qemu-i486/ostest and nsh: The QEMU i486 port is complete.
	  it now passes the OS test and supports the NuttShell (NSH).
	* misc/drivers: Created a new directory to hold non-BSD licensed
	  drivers that may be added into NuttX via an installation script.
	* drivers/usbhost/usbhost_rtl8187.c: A decision was made to
	  incorporate code taken from the Linux kernel.  That changes the
	  licensing on this module to GPL.  To avoid licensing contamination,
	  this driver was moved to misc/drivers/rtl8187x *prior* to adding
	  any of the GPL logic.  There is an INSTALL.sh script at the location
	  where the GPL driver(s) can be re-installed into the NuttX source
	  tree.  By re-installing the driver, you agree to the GPL licsensing
	  and all of its implications.
	* Makefile, apps/Makefile, tools/configure.sh: add logic to copy
	  configs/<board>/<config>/appdir to apps/.config and to simply the
	  application configuration logic.
	* examples/nsh and apps/nshlib: Move the core NuttShell (NSH) logic
	  out of the exemples directory and into the apps/ directory where
	  it belongs.
	* apps/Makefile and configs/*/appconfig: Use '=' as the delimiter
	  instead of '/' so that sub-directories in apps/ can be used.
	* apps/vsn: Move all VSN apps to apps/vsn.
	* nuttx/examples moved to apps/examples

6.1 2011-04-11 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* arch/arm/include/lpc17xx/irq.h and arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_gpio*.c:
	  Fix several bugs in the GPIO interrupt logic.  Submited by
	  Decio Renno.
	* Initialization for the CONFIG_APPS_DIR is now supported during the
	  earlier, 'context' build phase.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17_gpioint.c: Finish coding of the LPC17xx GPIO
	  interrupt logic.
	* net/netdev_unregister.c: Add capability to un-register a network
	  device.
	* drivers/mmcsd/mmcsd_sdio.c: extra effort to correctly handle cases
	  without the SDcard (but one issue still exists in STM32)
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_tim.*: Added basic timer support TIM1..TIM8
	  with output PWMs and interrupt logic
	* config/vsn/src: added basic support for Sensor Interface (GPIO and
	  PWM Power Output, and the sif utility program)
	* fs/: Reorgnize header so that file systems can be built outside
	  of the nuttx source tree
	* apps/namedapp/binfs.c: Create a tiny filesystem that can be used
	  to show the internal named apps under /bin.
	* fs/fs_opendir.c: Correct an error that occurs when a file system is
	  mounted in the root directory.  This was discovered while mounting
	  the named app's /bin directory.
	* lib/: Move all source files into a subdirectory of lib/ named after
	  the header file in which the library function is prototyped.
	* sched/ and lib/pthread/:  Move pthread attribute-related interfaces
	  from sched/ to lib/pthread where they more appropriately belong.
	* sched/ and lib/semaphore/:  Move some semaphore-related interfaces
	  from sched/ to lib/pthread where they more appropriately belong.
	* syscall/: The beginnings of an optional syscall kernal interface.
	* tools/mksyscall.c:  Add a tool that will auto-generate syscall proxies
	  and stubs from a comma-separated-value (CSV) data file.
	* arch/arm/src/cortexm3/mpu.h: Add a header file describing the Cortex-M3
	  MPU registers.
	* Numerous modifications to the build system.  Various people have reported
	  build problems since the re-organization and release of NuttX-6.0.  I am
	  unable to replicate the build problems in my environment, but the changes
	  have be incorporated in hope of correcting the build issues in other
	  environments.
	* drivers/i2c/st_lis331dl.c:  I2C-based driver for the LIS331DL MEMS
	  motion sensor.  Contributed by Uros Platise.
	* Makefile: The NuttX build system  will now supported building NuttX as two
	  separately linked images: (1) a kernel-mode RTOS image, and (2) a user-
	  mode application image that communicates to the RTOS kernel via system
	  calls.  A lot more still must be done.
	* user_initialize(): Eliminated the user_initialize() initialization hook.
	  It is difficult to maintain and redundant:  Board level initialization
	  an up_initialize() provide the same kind of capability.
	* arch/*/include/*/type.h: On some compilers, char defaults as unsigned.
	  Explicitly add signed to integer types if signed is what is required.
	* arch/*: For all architectures -- Global register state save structure
	  (usually called current_regs) should be marked volatile; Added general
	  capability to support nested interrupts (not fully realized for all
	  architectures).
	* sched/task_create.c: Add support for starting kernel-mode thread.
	* drivers/usbdev/usbdev_serial.c: Fix reported by Sheref Younan.  USB
	  was being reset after serial driver was closed.  As a result, you could
	  no reopen the serial driver.
	* configs/lpcxpresso-lpc1768: Add a board configuration for the Embedded
	  Artists LPCXpresso LPC1768 board.

6.2 2011-05-06 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_gpioint.c: Correct errors in logic that maps
	  and IRQ number into a register bit number.
	* Makefile: Fix an error introduced in the top-level Makefile in NuttX-6.1.
	  This error only shows up if you have a /tftpboot directory.  Then the 
	  make will fail with an obscure error about not being able to stat pass2.
	* configs/lpcxpresso-lpc1768/nsh: Add an NSH configuration for the
	  LPCXpresso board.
	* configs/*/ld.script: Removed 'sh_link not set for section .ARM.edix' for
	  a few of the builds.  In you have this warning, it can be removed with the
	  following change to the ld.script file:
	  
		+ __exidx_start = ABSOLUTE(.);
		.ARM.exidx : {
		-     __exidx_start = ABSOLUTE(.);
		      *(.ARM.exidx*)
		-     __exidx_end = ABSOLUTE(.);
		} >sram
		+  __exidx_end = ABSOLUTE(.);

	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx: Correct some typos/bugs in configuration of LPC17xx
	  UART2 and UART3.
	* nuttx/clock.h: Replace all references to the global variable g_system_timer
	  with clock_systemtimer() (currently just a macro that that returns g_system_timer).
	* lib/string/strrch.c: Would fail if the searched-for character were the first
	  character in the string.
	* tools/version.sh and mkversion.c: Tools to manage a NuttX version number
	  file
	* sched/clock_getutc() and lib/time/lib_time.c: Add support for 1 second UTC
	  interface.
	* net/net_dup2.c and include/nuttx/net.h: The conditional compilation for
	  '#if CONFIG_NFILE_DESCRIPTOR > 0' was wrong in both of these files.  It should
	  be '#if CONFIG_NFILE_DESCRIPTORS > 0'.  This causes a dup2() failure in THTTPD
	  and a failure to get a CGI page.  The consequence can be a very serious bug!
	* configs/lpcxpresso-lpc1768/usbstorage, thttpd, and dhcpd: Add an USB storage,
	  THTTPD web server, and DHCP server configurations for the NXP LPCXpresso board.
	* drivers/lcd/ug-9664hswag01.c and ssd1305.h: Add support for Univision UG-9664HSWAG01
	  OLED with Solomon Systech SD1305 LCD controller.
	* configs/lpcxpresso-lpc1668/nx: Add a NX graphics configuration for the LPCXPRESO
	  board.
	* graphics/nxglib/nxglib_nonintersecting.c: Fix some single bit errors in
	  calculation of non-intersecting regions.  This was causing an anomaly
	  in examples/nx in column 0.
	* drivers/mtd/rammtd.c: Added a RAM based MTD driver.  This RAM driver simulates
	  FLASH and is useful for testing purposes.
	* arch/arm/src/arm/up_head.S: Fix backward conditional compilation.  This cause
	  the configs/mx1ads configuration to fail to build but does not appear to affect
	  any other ARM9 build.
	* fs/nxffs: Adding a tiny, wear-leveling FLASH file system for NuttX.  This
	  file system is intended to be small and will have some limitations.  The
	  implementation is incomplete on initial checkin.
	* apps/examples/nxffs and configs/sim/nxffs:  Add a test a a configuration that
	  will be used to verify NXFFS.
	* fs/fat/fs_fat32.c and fs_fat32util.c: Incorpated two bugs with fixed provided
	  by Sheref Younan.  Thanks!
	* fs/nxffs: After a couple of weeks of testing and bug fixes, NXFSS appears
	  stable and functional.

6.3 2011-05-15 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* Remove clock_getutc().  It is replaces with clock_gettime(CLOCK_ACTIVETIME).
	  Add other RTC related changes provided by Uros Platise.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_flash.c: Add support for access to on-chip STM32
	  FLASH; beginning of integration with NXFFS (Uros Platise).
	* arch/mips: Added directory structure for PIC32 support
	* configs/pcblogic-pic32mx:  Add directory structure for PCB Logic PIC32MX board
	* apps/include:  Move include/apps to apps/include.  A symbolic link is created at
	  build time
	* Makefile: Removed support for Pascal pcode interpreter.  Support for that
	  interpreter has been moved to apps/interpreter/Makefile.
	* tools/mkdep.sh: Should not report an error if there are no files on the command
	  line.  This happens normally in certain configurations.
	* drivers/usbhost: Sheref Younan reported an error in the error handling when
	  connection to a USB device fails.  In certain fail cases, the logic would try
	  to free the device class instance twice, the first was okay, but the second
	  caused a crash.
	* graphics/nxbe/nxbe_colormap.c: Fix error noted by Bassem Fahmy.  The function
	  nxbe_colormap was change to nxbe_configure... apparently "search-and-replace"
	  error. This error was not noticed before because most NX platforms do not use
	  colormapping.
	* arch/rgmp and configs/rgmp.  Add architecture support and build
	  configuration for RGMP.  RGMP is a project for running GPOS and
	  RTOS simultaneously on multi-processor platforms. See
	  http://rgmp.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page for further
	  information about RGMP.
	* lib/stdio/lib_fclose.c: Must flush all buffered data when the file is closed.
	  Instead, it was discarding the buffered data.
	* lib/stdio: All output stream logic was modified to support CONFIG_STDIO_LINEBUFFER.
	  If standard C buffered I/O is enabled (CONFIG_STDIO_BUFFER_SIZE > 0), then this
	  option may be added to force automatic, line-oriented flushing the output buffer
	  for putc(), fputc(), putchar(), puts(), fputs(), printf(), fprintf(), and vfprintf().
	  When a newline is encountered in the output string, the output buffer will be
	  flushed.  This (slightly) increases the NuttX footprint but supports the kind of
	  behavior that people expect for printf.

6.4 2011-06-06 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* lib/drivers/cc1101: Add initial, functional CC1101 wireless driver
	  (contributed by Uros Platise)
	* arch/mips and configs/pcblogic-pic32mx: The MicroChip PIC32MX port is now
	  code complete and ready to begin testing.  Unfortunately, it looks like
	  testing will be delayed due to tool issues (My PICkit 2 will not work the
	  the MPLAB debugger on PIC32; I will need to get a PICkit 3).
	* drivers/net/e1000.c/h: A PCI-based E1000 Ethernet driver submitted
	  by Yu Qiang.
	* lib/net/lib_inetaddr.c: An implementation of the inet_addr() function
	  submitted by Yu Qiang.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc31xx and arch/arm/include/lpc31xx:  Renamed from lpc313x
	  to make name space for other famiy members.
	* arch/arm/*/lpc31xx: Added support for the LPC315x family (untested).
	* sched/task_exithook.c: Functionality performed when a task exits or is
	  deleted has been moved to a common file task_exithook.c.  Now exit()
	  functionality (like flushing I/O and calling registered atexit()
	  functions, etc.) will be performed when a task is deleted as well.
	* mm/:  Added support for CONFIG_MM_SMALL. Each memory allocation has a
	  small allocation overhead.  The size of that overhead is normally
	  determined by the "width" of the address support by the MCU.  MCUs
	  that support 16-bit addressability have smaller overhead than devices
	  that support 32-bit addressability.  However, there are many MCUs
	  that support 32-bit addressability *but* have internal SRAM of size
	  less than or equal to 64K.  In this case, CONFIG_MM_SMALL can be
	  defined so that those MCUs will also benefit from the smaller, 16-
	  bit-based allocation overhead.
	* lib/string/lib_strndup.c: Add standard strndup() library function.
	* net/getsockname.c: Added standard getsockname() to return the local
	  address associated with a socket.
	* lib/stdio/lib_asprintf.c: Add asprintf()
	* configs/olimex-lpc1766stk/ftpc:  Add a configuration to support
	  testing of the FTP client shell.
	* fd/fs_fdopen.c and net/net_checksd.c: Add support so that fdopen may
	  be used with socket descriptors.
	* net/recvfrom.c: Fix an error found in receiving small files via FTP:
	  The small file is received a buffered in the readahead buffer, then the
	  socket is disconnected.  When the app calls recvfrom, the socket is
	  already disconnected and the buffered data is stranded.  Now, recvfrom
	  will continue to return success after the socket is disconnected until
	  the readahead buffer is drained.
	* olimex-lp1766stk/ftpc/defconfig: Many configurations have the MTU 
	  (CONFIG_NET_BUFSIZE) set to very small numbers, less then the minimum
	  MTU size that must be supported -- 576. This can cause problems in
	  some networks:  CONFIG_NET_BUFSIZE should be set to at least 576 in
	  all defconfig files.  This has only been fixed in this defconfig file.

6.5 2011-06-21 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* arch/avr/src/avr and arch/avr/include/avr: Adds general support for
	  the Atmel 8-bit AVR family.
	* arch/avr/src/atmega and arch/avr/include/atmega: Adds support for the
	  Atmel AVR ATMega family.
	* arch/avr/src/at90usb and arch/avr/include/at90usb: Adds support for the
	  Atmel AVR AT90USB family.
	* configs/micropendous3: Adds a board configuration for the Opendous
	  Micropendous 3 board.  This board may be populated with several different
	  members of the Atmel AVR AT90USB family.
	* configs/amber: This is a placehold for the Atmel ATMega128 Amber Web
	  Server from SoC Robotics.  Not much present in this directory on initial
	  check-in.
	* configs/teensy: Adds a board configuration for the PJRC Teensy++ 2.0 board
	  that features an Atmel AT90USB1286 MCU.
	* fs/fat: Offsets, sector numbers, etc. need to be off_t, not size_t.  size_t
	  is intended to be the maximum size of a memory object, not a file offset. This
	  does not make any difference except on systems (like the AVR) where size_t
	  is only 16-bits.

6.6 2011-07-11 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* drivers/mtd/ramtron.c, net/net_checksd.c, fs/fs_fdopen.c, and include/nuttx/mii.h:
	  Several structural changes made to get a clean compile under the ez80 ZDS-II
	  toolchain (no design changes).
	* drivers/usbhost/usbhost_storage.c: Incorpated bugfixes reported by Sheref H.
	  Younan:  (1) Read capacity logic read largest block, not the number of blocks
	  and was, therefore, off by one, and (2) Some devices stall of get Max LUN request
	  if they support only a single LUN.  Logic now assumes a single LUN if the get
	  Max LUN request fails.
	* include/nuttx/arch.h, lib/stdio/lib_libvsprintf.c, lib/stdio/lib_fputs.c: Add
	  a new configuration option to support extracting strings from FLASH or EEPROM
	  or other memories where the string data cannot be accessed by simply de-referencing
	  a string pointer.
	* arch/sim/src/up_romgetc.c: Used to test the basic logic to access strings
	  without directly de-referencing a string pointer.
	* arch/avr/src/avr/up_romget.c: Used to access strings that lie in the first
	  64K of FLASH (But I still haven't figured out how to get strings to reside in
	  FLASH without using the PROGMEM attribute).
	* configs/teensy/src/up_spi.c: Correct reading of SD CD and WP pins (was reading
	  the wrong register.  AVR SPI now appears to be functional.
	* arch/avr/src/at90usb/at90usb_usbdev.c: Correct USB initialization.  Interrupts
	  were being enabled BEFORE the interrupt handler was attached.
	* configs/sure-pic32mx:  Add a configuration for the Sure Electronics, "Advanced USB
	  Storage Demo Board," Model DB-DP11215 (http://www.sureelectronics.net/goods.php?id=1168).
	  This board features the MicroChip PIC32MX440F512H MCU. (Untested on initial
	  check-in).
	* configs/stm3210e-eval/nsh2:  Add another NSH configuration for the STM32 with
	  some different properties.
	* CONFIG_NSH_CONDEV:  Add a configuration option to allow using a different character
	  device (such a a different UART) for the NSH interface.  This allows, for example,
	  debug output to come from the console device while using another device for NSH.
	  There are some issues on initial check-in:  NuttX doesn't have termios and the
	  console device has special properties that make using NSH awkward.  Examples:
	  No CR-LF expansion, no character echoing, no command line editting.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_lowputc.c and stm32_serial.c.  Correct seversl bugs
	  involving serial port configuration.  These bugs are only critical if you
	  are trying to using multiple UARTs on STM32.
	* configs/stm3210e-eval/src/up_lcd.c:  Add a driver for the STM3210E-EVAL's LCD.
	* configs/stm3210e-eval/nx:  Add NX configuration for the STM3210E-EVAL.
	* configs/nuttx/arch.h (and arch/arm/src/stm32, configs/*/src/up_buttons.c):
	  Standardize interfaces exported for button support and button interrupts.
	* configs/stm3210e-eval/src/up_buttons.c:  Add interrupting button support.
	  Also fixes a few errors in STM3210E-EVAL button decoding.
	* configs/stm3210e-eval/buttons: Add a configuration to exercise STM3210E-EVAL
	  buttons.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_gpio.c:  GPIO interrupt handling for pin
	  numbers were being aliased:  5-9 together and 10-15 together.  Extended
	  the logic to peform decoding of GPIO interrupts and unique dispatching
	  for all 16 pins.
	* configs/stm3210e-eval/nxtext: Add a configuration for the apps/examples/nxtext
	  example.  This example focuses on placing text on the background while
	  pop-up windows occur.  Text should continue to update normally with or without
	  the popup windows present.
	* arch/arm/src/common/up_checkstack.c:  ARM stack overflow checking submitted
	  by Hal Glenn.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx: Changes to compile successfully with no serial console
	  (also submitted by Hal Glenn).
	* graphics/nxfonts/nxfonts_convert.c:  Fixed a critical bug that caused
	  when renderer some fonts with bits-per-pixel > 8
	* graphics/nxbe/nxbe_move.c: Fixed an error in the graphics move logic (This
	  was a previously untested interface).  Basically, there is some confusion
	  between use of (x,y) as a relative offset or as an absolute position.
	* graphics/nxbe/nxbe_close.c:  Fixed an important graphics system bug:
	  When a window is closed, the display was not being updated.  The old
	  window graphic was left on the display for a time.

6.7 2011-08-02 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* Makefile:  Added a export target that will bundle up all of the NuttX
	  libraries, header files, and the startup object into an export-able
	  tarball.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_can.h:  Correct some typos in the CAN
	  register definitions.
	* drivers/serial/serialirq.c:  Correct an error that can occur if the
	  serial RX buffer becomes full.  Data is now discarded in that case;
	  before, leaving data in the hardware would cause infinite interrupts
	  one most MCUs since you must read the data in order to clear the
	  interrupt.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_can.c:  Added a CAN driver contributed by
	  Li Zhuoyi (Lzyy).
	* include/stddefs.h and sys/types:  Added type wchar_t.
	* fs/fat/fat_fat32dirent.c:  Move all FAT directory operations to this
	  new file; Implement VFAT long file name support.
	* fs/fat/fat_fat32dirent.c:  The configuration CONFIG_FAT_LCNAMES has
	  been around for some time but never tested until now.  This setting
	  will mimic the NT 8.3 file name behavior:  File names or extensions 
	  may be all upper or all lower case (but not mixed).  If
	  CONFIG_FAT_LCNAMES is not selected, all filenames are strictly upper
	  case.
	* configs/stm3210e-eval/nsh2:  Console is back on UART1; Added
	  examples/nx as an NSH "built-in" command as a demonstration.
	* fs/fat/fs_fat32dirent.c:  Fix an important bug in the directory
	  allocation (fat_allocatedirentry()).  I looks like it could be
	  initializing the wrong sectors! NOTE:  This function was in
	  fs_fat32utils.c in earlier releases.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32_sdio.c: Correct an important DMA-related bug;
	  SDIO transfer completion events and DMA completion eventes were
	  not being coordinated correctly.
	* configs/stm3210e-eval/nsh2: Enable FAT long file name support
	* sched/sem_timedwait.c: Add the standard sem_timedwait() interface.
	* graphics/nxfonts/nxfonts_getfont.c, nxfonts_bitmap.c,
	  Makefile.source, and include/nuttx/nxfonts.h: Support for multiple
	  fonts included.  A new interface, nxf_getfonthandle() takes a font
	  ID and returns a handle that is now used at all other font interfaces
	  to specify which of the multiple fonts to use.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_syscon.h: Fix typo (reported by Li Zhuoyi).
	* configs/stm3210e-eval/nsh2: Extended to support two new commands:
	  'msconn' will connect the USB mass storage device; 'msdis' will
	  disconnect the USB storage device.
	* tools/bdf-converter.c.  This C file is used to build the bdf-converter
	  program.  The bdf-converter program be used to convert fonts in Bitmap
	  Distribution Format (BDF) into fonts that can be used in the NX graphics
	  system.
	* include/nuttx/nx:  Move all NX header files from include/nuttx to 
	  include/nuttx/nx.
	* drivers/usbdev/usbdev_usbstorage.c and arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_usbdev.c:
	  Correct a memory leak when the USB mass storage driver is connected and
	  then disconnected from the target.  The write requests were not being
	  freed.  NOTE that the unregister logic in the STM32 needed to call
	  stm32_reset() in order to return the write requests to the USB mass
	  storage driver; it is possible that a similar but could exist for other
	  architectures.
	* graphics/nxfonts/nxfonts_*.h:  Add serveral more new fonts
	* arch/z80/src/ez80/ez80_serial.c: Fix some errors in serial driver
	  setup for UART1 (submitted by Paul Osmialowski).
	* drivers/input/tsc2007.c and include/nuttx/input/*:  Add a generic NuttX
	  touchscreen interface.  Add a driver for the TI TSC2007 touchscreen
	  controller.
	* graphics/nxglib/lcd and fb:  Add low level routines to set single pixels.
	* lib/math/lib_b16atan2.c:  Add a fixed precision atan2() function
	* graphics/nxglib/nxglib_splitline.c: Add logic to divide a wide line into
	  trapezoidal components.
	* graphics/nxmu/nx_drawline.c, graphics/nxsu/nx_drawline.c,
	  graphics/nxtk/nxtk_drawlinewindow.c, graphics/nxtk/nxtk_drawlinetoolbar.c:
	  Add new line drawing interfaces (untested).

6.8 2011-08-19 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/chip.h:  Fix some chip memory configuration errors
	  for the LPC1764, LPC1756, and LPC1754 (submitted by Li Zhuoy (Lzyy))
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_can.h:  Revised CAN driver submitted by
	   Li Zhuoy (Lzyy).  The driver now supports both CAN1 and CAN2.
	* arch/arm/sim/up_lcd.c: Add a simulated LCD driver.
	* configs/stm3210e-eval/nxlines:  Added a configuration to build
	  examples/nxlines.
	* arch/graphics: Used apps/examples/nxlines to (finally) verify the NX
	  trapezoid drawing functions and (wide) line drawing functions.
	* arch/rgmp and configs/rgmp.  Yu Qiang has ported RGMP to the OMAP4430 (arm)
	  pandaboard and release the new RGMP 0.3 version. The main changes are: (1)
	  Separate configs/rgmp/x86 and configs/rgmp/arm configuration directory, and
	  (2) Extract architecture dependent code in arch/rgmp/include and
	  arch/rgmp/src into corresponding x86/ and arm/ directories.
	* arch/arm/src/kinetis, arch/arm/include/kinetis, configs/kwikstick-k40:
	  Add a directory structure to support the port to the Kinetis KwikStik-K40.
	  There is no real substance in the initial check-in; only the directory
	  structure and skeleton files (Code complete on 8/15/11).
	* arch/arm/include/armv7-m, arch/arm/src/armv7-m, etc.: Rename all cortexm3
	  directories and files to armv7-m; Change name of of all CORTEXM3 constants
	  to ARMV7M.  This is a major namespace change needed to cleanly support the
	  ARM Cortex-M4 which is also in the ARMv7 M Series (specifically, ARMv7E-M).
	* sched/sig_initialize.c, sig_received.c, and mq_waitirq.c.  Fixed several
	  critical bugs related to signal handling initialization and for signals
	  the wake up tasks that are waiting to send or receive message queues.  In
	  the first two files, errors would prevent proper allocation of signal-related
	  structures from interrupt handlers.  In the second, there was missing
	  "clean-up" logic after a signal occurred, leaving the message queue in
	  a bad state and resulting in PANICs.  All are important.  (submitted by
	  hkwilton).
	* arch/arm/src/kinetis:  Added header files defining all Kinetis registers
	  and bit fields within all Kinetis registers.
	* configs/twr-k60n512:  Add support for the Kinetis K60 Tower board
	  (TWR-K60N512).
	* drivers/can.c:  Fixed a semaphore overflow problem in the CAN driver
	  (reported by Li Zhouy (Lzyy)).
	* 8/18/2011: The basic port to the FreeScale Kinetics TWR-K60N512 board is
	  now functional.
	* confgs/twr-k60n512: Add Kinetics TWR-K60N512 NSH configuration.
	* drivers/analog and include/nuttx/analog: Add ADC driver infrastructure
	  and TI ADS1255 driver developed and submitted by Li Zhouy (Lzyy)).
	* arch/arm/stm32/stm32_sdio.h and drivers/mmcsd/mmcsd.c:  Add logic to
	  multiplex usage of the GPIO pins (contributed by Uros Platise).
	* configs/twr-k60n512/nsh:  Added and verified a NuttShell (NSH)
	  configuration for the Freescale, Kinetis TWR-K60N512 board.

6.9 2011-09-11 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* arch/arm/src/kinetis/kinetis_sdhc.c: SDHC driver for Kinetis parts.
	  Initially check-in is just a crude port of the STM32 SDIO driver.
	  Much more work is needed.
	* graphics/, include/nuttx/nx:  Add new NX interfaces for drawing
	  circles -- both circular outlines and filled circles.
	* graphic/nxglib/nxglib_spitline.c:  Add a "fudge factor" that eliminates
	  some problems for rendering nearly horizontal, wide lines.  Hmm...
	  but I suspect this fudge factor also leads to new problems rendering
	  very thin, nearly horizontal lines.  More tuning is needed.
	* drivers/analog, include/nuttx/analog, arch/arch/src/lpcxx:  (1) Add
	  updates to the ADS1255 driver, (2) fix errors from my last merge (sorry),
	  (3) Add DAC infrastructure, (4) add AD5410 DAC driver, and (5) add
	  LPC17xx ADC and DAC drivers.  All contributed by Li Zhuoyi (Lzyy).
	* tools/mkexport.sh:  Extended the script that implements the top-level
	  'make export' logic.  The script now also finds and bundles up all of
	  the architecture-specific header files as well.
	* drivers/arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_i2c.c:  Add a reset to the I2C
	  initialization logic to prevent spurious interrupts when the I2C
	  interrupts are enabled (submitted by Uros Platise).
	* Scripts/makefiles/documents.  Several adjustments, corrections and
	  typo fixes so that NuttX will build correctly on FreeBSD using the
	  ASH shell (submitted by Kurt Lidl).
	* drivers/mtd/flash_eraseall.c:  Add a callable function that accepts
	  the path to a block driver and then erases the underlying FLASH memory
	  (assuming that the block driver is an MTD driver wrapped in the FTL
	  layer).  Hmmm... this is probably not the best long term solution;
	  flash_eraseall() should be a user-callable function that operates
	  one driver interfaces; not an internal, OS function that operates
	  on directly on block drivers.
	* drivers/bch:  Fixed some important bugs in the BCH driver (noted by
	  Li Zhuoyi (Lzyy)).  This would have effected any large reads or writes
	  (larger than the hardware sector size).
	* arch/*/src/Makefile:  Use of -print-libgcc-file-name to get path to
	  libgcc.a may select the wrong libgcc.a if a multilib toolchain (like
	  CodeSourcery) is used. This can be a serious problem and can cause
	  crashes on Cortex-M3 if the ARM libgcc is used, for example.  The fix 
	  is to include ARCHCPUFLAGS on the gcc command line when asking it to
	  -print-libgcc-file-name.
	* lib/time/lib_gmtimer.c:  Correct several calculations that could lead
	  to errors in dates.
	* drivers/pm: Add the beginnings of a NuttX power management sub-system.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_irq.c:  Fix a error introduced in 6.8.
	  Timeout calculation uses clock_settime() instead of clock_gettime().
	  Pretty gross error, but actually it works with the side effect of setting
	  a bad time.
	* drivers/mtd/at24xx.c: Driver for I2C-based at24cxx EEPROM submitted by
	  Li Zhuoyi (Lzyy).
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_i2c.c: I2C driver for the NXP LPC17xx family
	  submitted by Li Zhuoyi (Lzyy)
	* arch/arm/src/stm32_i2c.c:  Correct two issues with the STM32 I2C driver:
	  (1) Clocking needs to be based on PCLK1, not HCLK and fast speed settings
	  need some additional bits; and (2) Correct a hang that will occur on
	  I2C1 if FSMC is also enabled.
	* drivers/sensors/lm75.c and include/nuttx/sensors/lm75.h:  Add an LM-75
	  temperature sensor driver.
	* configs/stm3210e-eval/src/up_lm75.c:  Add support for the LM-75 on the
	  STMicro STM3210E-EVAL board.
	* sched/clock_gettime.c:  Correct an error in the tv_nsec calculation
	  that happens only config CONFIG_RTC is enabled.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_i2c.c:  Correct some bugs related to waiting
	  for the I2C STOP condition to be cleared.

6.10 2011-10-06 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* lib/stdio/lib_fopen.c:  Fix an error in fopen(); the file pointer was not
	  being positioned at the end of the file when the "a" and "a+" modes are
	  used.  There are other issues with the "a+" modes (see the top-level TODO
	  list).
	* drivers/usbdev/cdc_serial.c and include/nuttx/usb/cdc.h and cdc_serial.h:
	  Add support for the CDC ACM serial device class.
	* fs/fat/fs_fat32.c: Fix a critical bug in the write logic:  It a tiny write
	  cross a sector boundary, then two sector writes will occur.  The first part
	  in the first sector may be written to the wrong sector number.
	* fs/fat/fs_fat32util.c:  Fix a stray write into the FAT (always sector 964 on
	  FAT32).  This bug will cause some lost chains.  I'm sure this bug could
	  corrupt files but at present, the only thing I have seen is that before
	  fixing this bug, the Windows chkdsk utility would report these lost chains.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_i2c.c: Driver can now operate in a faster polled
	  mode (at the expense of using more cpu cycles).
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_i2c.c: Add trace debug capability.  Enabled with
	  CONFIG_I2C_TRACE.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_i2c.c: Fix another bug where I2C conflicts with FSMC
	  being enabled.  That time at the tail end of the transaction where there is
	  an unfinished stop condition.
	* sched/mq_timedreceive.c and sched/mq_timedsend.c:  The count of threads
	  waiting on the message queues was not being decremented after a timeout.
	  This would cause the accounting logic to become out of sync and the, perhaps,
	  an assertion to be triggered.  This is an important bug and fixes a
	  potential crash when using mq_timedreceived() and mq_timedsend().
	* sched/mq_sndinternal.c: Related to the above, the send logic was incrementing
	  the wrong counter when it waited as part of the mq_timedsend.c logic.
	* fs/fat:  Fix an error in the long file name logic:  If the long file name
	  is an even multiple of 13 bytes in length, then it should not include a
	  NULL terminating character.  Fix contributed by Kaushal Parikh.
	* configs/sim/nx11: Created a separate configuration to build the NX
	  example using the a simulated framebuffer driver on an X11 window.  This
	  example has been verified on Ubuntu 9.09 (it does not work on Cygwin).
	* arch/sim/src/up_touchscreen.c and up_x11eventloop.c: Adds support for a
	  simulated NuttX touchscreen device using mouse/pointer feedback from an
	  x11 window.
	* configs/sim/touchscreen: Adds a configuration to verify the simulated
	  touchscreen driver (Does not work on Cygwin).
	* configs/sam3u/touchscreen: This is the configuration that I plan to use
	  to verify the SAM3U-EK touchscreen driver.  However, as of this writing,
	  there is no touchscreen driver for the board.
	* CONFIG_RTC_HIRES: Add an option to support either a high-resolution RTC
	  that completely replaces the system timer tick but may overflow and lose
	  time when the MCU is off and also for a low-resolution (1 sec/tick) RTC
	  that can run until 2106 with no overflow.  But in this latter case, higher
	  resolution time must come from the system timer.
	* CONFIG_SYSTEM_UTC: Removed support for the UTC system timer.  It just
	  doesn't do enough to be worth the CPU cycles or the complexity.
	* CONFIG_SYSTEM_TIME16: Added support for an optional 64-bit system timer.
	* fs/fat/fs_fat32util.c: Add support for FAT date/time stamps; Enabled via
	  CONFIG_FS_FATTIME.
	* arch/arm/src/sam3u/sam3u_spi.c: Add an SPI driver for the AT91SAM3U.
	* drivers/input/ads7843e.c and include/nuttx/input/ads7843e.h: Add a
	  driver for the TI ADS7843E touchscreen controller.
	* fs/nxffs/nxffs_open.c:  Fix an error when a file is open for writing; since
	  the file will get deleted it is already exists, there must be a check if
	  there are other open references to the file.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_sdio.c: Fixed an error where during SDHC
	  initialization interrupts were not being re-enabled.  Caused more subtle
	  errors than you would think.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_i2c.c:  Fixed an error where I2C timeouts appeared
	  to be successful transfers.
	* configs/sim/nsh2: Add another simulated NSH configuration.  This one
	  supports X11 graphics, C++, and exercises graphic functions as built-in
	  commands.

6.11 2011-11-12 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* arch/arm/stm32/Make.defs:  Don't build stm32_rtc.c if CONFIG_RTC is not
	  selected.  Doing so will cause errors if other configuration dependencies
	  are not met.
	* configs/stm3210e-eval/src/up_lcd.c:  Color corrections for SPFD5408B LCD
	  do not work with R61580 LCD.
	* configs/pic32-starterkit: Beginning of a configuration for the Microchip
	  PIC32 Ethernet Starter Kit.  Hmmm.. I don't have a clue how to test this
	  with no serial port?!
	* lib/stdio/lib_fclose.c: fclose() always returns an error (EOF) when it
	  closes a read-only file.  This is because it calls flush() which will
	  fail on read-only files.  No harm is done other that a bad value is
	  returned.
	* arch/sim/src/Makefile: Correct build issue for sim/nsh2 target.  Old
	  libboard.a was not being cleaned.
	* arch/mips/src/pic32mx/pic32mx-gpio*.c:  Add GPIO support for the PIC32MX.
	* configs/sure-pic32mx/src/up_leds.c and up_buttons.c:  Add button and LED
	  support for the Sure Electronics PIC32MX board.
	* configs/ea3152:  Add a configuration for the Embedded Artists LPC3152
	  daughter board (with the same base-board used with configs/ea3131)
	* graphics/nxmu/nx_getrectangle.c, graphics/nxsu/nx_getrectangle.c,
	  graphics/mxtk/nx_getwindow.c, graphics/nxmu/nx_gettoobar.c:  New
	  interfaces to read from graphics memory
	* graphics/nxbe/nxbe_bitmap.c: Fix an error in the error handling that
	  can cause valid bitmaps to fail to render.
	* include/nuttx/rgbcolors.h: Fix errors in some 16- and 8-bit color
	  conversion macros.
	* tools/incdir.sh: Fix issues when g++ is used as the compiler.  It was
	  not being recognized and handled properly.
	* graphics/nxsu/nx_releasebkgd.c: Fix a bad cast that was causing
	  problems with the background window was released.
	* fs/nxffs/nxffs_pack.c:  Correct a critical bug in the NXFFS file system:
	  When repacking the filesystem, there was a missing check to see if an
	  inode structure would fit at the end of a block.  This is a rare case
	  if the block size is large, but can be common for tiny block sizes
	  and results in a crash and file system corruption.
	* fs/nxffs/nxffs_initialize.c:  Fix an initialize error.  If the FLASH
	  is full on power-up, NXFFS will fail to initialize correctly.
	* fs/nxffs/nxffs_write.c and nxffs_pack.c:  Fix an error that can occur
	  when attempt to write to FLASH volume that is completely full but
	  has no value inodes on it.
	* drivers/mtd/at24xx.c:  Now supports a configurable block size that
	  supports using "clusters" of AT24 pages as blocks.  This allows bigger
	  block sizes and more efficient use of EEPROM when the AT24 is used to
	  support a file system (such as NXFFS). (Contributed by Hal Glenn).
	* include/nuttx/rgbcolors.h: More fixes to RGB color conversion
	  macros.
	* arch/arm/src/common/up_createstack.c and up_usestack.c:  For ARM EABI
	  the stack must be aligned to 8-byte boundaries.  This is necessary for
	  passing aligned floating point values under EABI.  Fix contributed by
	  David Sidrane.
	* Numerous changes and fixes to the PIC32 interrupt handing logic. The
	  PIC32 port is almost complete but still not ready for prime time.

6.12 2011-12-06 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* fs/fat/fs_fat32util.c and fs_fat32.h: Logic extended to look in up to
	  four partitions for a valid FAT file system.
	* drivers/input/tsc2007.c: Add support for 8-bit conversions; make sure
	  that A/D converters are active before requesting conversions.
	* drivers/mmcsd0/mmcsd_sdio.c: Increase capacity variable from size_t
	  to uin64_t (if available) so that SD cards with capacities greater
	  than 4Gb can be supported.
	* fs/fat/fs_fat32dirent.c: The root directory structure is different
	  from other directories.  When formatted by Windows, it is not initialized
	  at all.  Some additional special handling is required to initialize the
	  root directory entry to interoperate correctly with windows.
	* fs/fat/fs_fat32util.c: In fat_systime2fattime(void) should be
	  clock_gettime() and not clock_gettime().  Also, there is a place where
	  FAT date is used instead of FAT time. (Thanks to David Sidrane).
	* arch/arm/src/stm32 and arch/arm/include/stm32:  Add support for the
	  STM32F40xxx family of MCUs.
	* configs/stm3240g-eval:  Add framework for the STMicro STM3240G-EVAL
	  board.
	* include/sys/types.h:  wchar_t is a builtin type in C++ and its
	  declaration can cause errors with certain C++ compilers.
	* sched/sig_timedwait.c:  Fix signal handling when the returned info
	  is NULL.  Before this change, it would derefence a NULL pointer
	  in this case.
	* graphics/nxfonts/nxfonts_sans17x22.h and nxfonts_sans20x26.h:  Add
	  some very small sans serif fonts.
	* graphics/nxfonts/nxfonts_sans17x23b.h and nxfonts_sans20x27b.h:  Add
	  corresponding sans serif bold fonts.
	* drivers/input/ads7843e.c and tsc2007.c:  Fix some errors in the poll
	  setup error checking that was cloned into both drivers.
	* sched/mq_notify.c:  Set errno appropriately on failures.  There are
	  still several message queue functions that do not set errno!
	* arch/arm/src/stm32: Fixes to several STM32F40xxx files (contributed by
	  Mikhail Bychek).
	* configs/stm3210e-eval/src/up_lcd.c:  Fix banding problem on the R61580
	  LCD
	* configs/stm3240g-eval/ostest:  The basic STM32F40xx bringup is functional
	  (11/12/06) for the STM3240G-EVAL board and passes the OS test.
	* configs/stm3240g-eval/nsh:  Adds a NuttShell (NSH) configure for the
	  STM3240G-EVAL board.

6.13 2011-12-26 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32f40xxx_dma.c:  Add DMA support for the STM32 F4
	  family (untested on initial check-in)
	* arch/arm/src/armv7-m/up_fpu.c:  Add logic for saving an restoring VFP
	  floating point registers on context switches (but also disable the FPU
	  because CodeSourcery doesn't support hard flowing point!)
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/chip/stm32_eth.h:  Add Ethernet register definitions
	  for the STM32 F4.
	* arch/arm/srcm/stm32/stm32_eth.c:  Adds an Ethernet driver for the STM32 F4.
	* arch/arm/srcm/stm32/stm32_dac.c and stm32_adc.c: "Skeleton" files for STM32
	  DAC and ADC drivers.  The actual logic will come later.
	* arch/arm/srcm/stm32/stm32_eth.c:  There may be a few more lurking bugs, but
	  the STM32 Ethernet driver appears to be fully functional on the STM3240G-EVAL.
	* arch/arm/srcm/stm32/stm32_eth.c:  Fix an error in clearing abnormal interrupt
	  events.
	* configs/stm3240g-eval/dhcpd:  Add a DCHP daemon configuration for the
	  STM3240G-EVAL board.
	* configs/stm3240g-eval/nettest:  Add a network test configuration for the
	  STM3240G-EVAL board.
	* arch/arm/srcm/stm32/stm32_rtc.c, stm32f10xxx_rtc.c, and stm32f40xxx_rtc:
	  Broke out separate drivers to handle the very different RTC implementations
	  in the STM32 F1 and F4 family.
	* arch/arm/srcm/stm32/stm32f10xxx_rtc.c:  STM32 F4 RTC is functional (12/14/2011)
	* net/uip-arp.c: Fix compilation issue with CONFIG_NET_ARP_IPIN
	* include/nuttx/pwm.h and drivers/pwm.c:  Add an interface definition and a
	  "upper half" driver for PWM output.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_pwm.c:  Added a PWM "lower half" driver for the
	  STM32.  The initial check-in is little more than a framework for the driver.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_usbdev.c:  Corrected two CRITICAL errors in the USB
	  device-side driver:  (1) Handling of data overrun condition was wrong.  When
	  there was no further memory to accept further OUT endpoint data, the driver
	  would hang with infinite interrupts; (2) the logic in setting toggle bits
	  was not correct.  However, this driver has functioned for a long time until
	  the particular condition that revealed the bug occurred.  My impression is
	  that this latter bugfix also fixes some STM32 USB performance problems.
	* configs/hymini-stm32v: A configuration for the HY-Mini STM32v board contributed
	  by Laurent Latil.  These changes also include support for the STM32F103VCT6. 
	* arch/configs/stm3240g-eval/src/up_pwm.c:  Add hooks needed to use the new
	  apps/examples/pwm test of the STM32 PWM  driver.
	* drivers/mtd/mp25x.c:  Add ability to use different SPI modes and different
	  manufacturers codes.  Fix a error in the wait for not busy (submitted by
	  Mohammad Elwakeel.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_can.c:  Add a low-level STM32 CAN driver. (Initial
	  check is incomplete).  Add loopback support to the driver.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_adc.c:  The ADC is now functional.  A more complete
	  driver would require DMA support.  I have some questions still about the
	  accuracy of the timer-driven sampling.
	* configs/sure-pic32mx/nsh:  The PIC32 port is (finally) functional.  Add an
	  NSH configuration for the Sure PIC32MX board.
	* configs/sure-pic32mx/*/defconfig.  Calibrated all PIC32 delay loops.
	* configs/pcblogic-pic32mx/nsh:  Add an NSH configuration for the PCBLogic
	  PIC32 board.
	* Both PIC32 OS test and NSH configurations have now been verified.

6.14 2012-01-15 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* tools/Makefile.export, mkexport.sh, and configure.sh:  Changes submitted
	  by Mike Smith to support configuration and 'make export' on MAC OS.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_gpio.c:  Disabled interrupts while configuring
	  GPIO pins so that we have exclusive access to the GPIO configuration
	  registers.
	* arch/mips/src/pic32mx/pic32mx_usbdev.c:  Add a USB device-side driver
	  for the PIC32MX family.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_gpio.c:  Correct an error in some of the GPIO
	  initialization logic.  Fix submitted by Mike Smith.
	* configs/olimex-lpc1766stk/src/up_leds.c:  Add new interfaces so that is
	  CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS are not set, the LEDs may be controlled from application
	  logic.
	* configs/olimex-lpc1766stk/src/up_buttons.c:  Add support for the buttons
	  on the Olimex LPC1766-STK board.
	* Makefile:  Added 'apps_clean' and 'apps_distclean' target to simplify
	  managing the state of the application directory while in the NuttX directory
	* Documentation/NuttXGettingStarted.html:  Added a "Getting Started" Guide
	  for NuttX.  At present, this is just a stub and it refers to the NuttX
	  top-level README.txt file which is the only, real "Getting Started" Guide
	  that exists at the time being.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_gpioint.c:  Correct an value used as the lower
	  end of an IRQ number range test.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_gpio.c:  Fix a integer flow problem in shift.
	  This error would prevent pins > 15 from being used as interrupt sources.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_can.c:  The CAN driver has been verified in
	  loopback mode on the STM3240G-EVAL board.
	* configs/stm3240g-eval/src/up_adc.c: Complete coding of ADC support for the
	  potentiometer on board the STM3240G-EVAL.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17_can.c:  Several CAN driver improvements. Adds support for
	  testing in loopback mode.  now uses all three transmit buffers for better
	  performance.
	* confgs/olimex-lpc1766stk/nsh:  Now supports the CAN loopback test as an
	  optional "built-in" application.
	* sched/irq_attach.c:  Fix an issue with disabling interrupts when they are
	  detached.  For the PIC32, this can't be done because there is a 1-to-many
	  relationship between vector numbers and interrupt numbers or different.
	  Added a new configuration option CONFIG_ARCH_VECNOTIRQ to at least flag
	  the architectures that have this issue and to (at least) avoid doing
	  something too wrong.
	* drivers/can.c:  Fix a test for buffer full in the generic, "upper half",
	  can driver.
	* arch/arm/src/lm3s: Add support for the LM3S6432S2E (Contributed by Mike Smith)
	* configs/lm3s6432-s2:  Add support for the TI RDK-S2E (LM3S6432S2E) board
	  (Contributed by Mike Smith)
	* configs/stm3240g-eval/src: Add APIs support to support user access to the
	  LEDs
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_can.c: Add logic to change the CAN bit rate based
	  on the NuttX configuration.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_can.c: PCLK divisor is now a configuration
	  option.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_serial.c and stm32_lowputc.c:  Support for
	  UART4-5 and USART6 added by Mike Smith.  Also includes a more flexible
	  way of managing UART pin configurations.
	* include/nuttx/pwm.h, drivers/pwm.c, arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_pwm.c:  Add
	  support for pulse count in order to better support stepper motors.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_dumpgpio.c: Checking wrong register to see if
	  GPIO is enabled.  Also not adding the GPIO base address to several offsets.
	* configs/stm32f4discovery:  Port to the STMicro STM32F4Discovery board
	  (Contributed by Mike Smith).
	* fs/fat/fs_fat32util.c:  On a failure to recognize a FAT file system, the
	  mount logic should return -EINVAL, not -ENODEV.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_tim.c:  Support for STM32 F4 32-bit timers
	  (Contributed by Mikhail Bychek)
	* lib/stdio/lib_vsprintf.c:  Add support for fixed-size fields with floating
	  point numbers (Contributed by Mikhail Bychek)

6.15 2012-02-12 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_pwm.c:  Pulse count was limited to 128; now is
	  (essentially) unlimited.
	* configs/stm3240g-eval/include/board.h:  Input frequencies wrong for all but
	  one APB2 timer.
	* arch/mips/src/pic32mx/pic32mx-ethernet.c:  The PIC32 Ethernet driver is
	  code complete, but still untested.
	* confgs/sim/*/Make.defs and arch/sim/src/Makefile:  Add support for building
	  a 32-bit executable on a 64-bit Linux target.
	* configs/sure-pic32mx/src/up_leds.c:  Correct GPIOs used for LEDs. The wrong
	  pins were being used.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/chip/stm32f10xxx_gpio.h: Correct offset to one AFIO EXICR
	  register.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_can.c:  Added "advanced" configuration options
	  to specify the CAN TSEG1 and TSEG2 clock counts specifically.
	* include/nuttx/can.h and drivers/can.c:  Add support for extended (29-bit)
	  CAN IDs.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_can.c:  Add support for extended (29-bit) CAN IDs.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_can.c:  Add support for extended (29-bit) CAN IDs.
	* include/nuttx/power/pm.h:  Move include/nuttx/pm.h into a sub-directory named
	  power.
	* drivers/power:  Rename the drivers/pm directory to power
	* include/power/battery.h and drivers/battery.c:  Add the interface definitions
	  for an upper and lower half battery driver.  Add the implementation of the
	  common upper half battery driver.
	* drivers/power/max1704x.c:  Add a driver for MAX17040x battery "fuel gauge"
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_i2c.c: Add support for I2C3
	* drivers/usbdev/: Lots of name changes: cdc_serial->cdcacm, usbstrg->usbmsc, 
	  usbser->pl2303
	* drivers/usbdev/composite: Fleshed out support for a composite USB device.
	* drivers/stm3210e-eval/composite and drivers/stm3210e-eval/src/up_composite.c:
	  Add a configuration test the USB composite device.
	* include/nuttx/usb/usb.h, drivers/usbdev/composite_descriptors.c, and
	  drivers/usbdev/cdcacm_descriptors.c:  Add support for the USB Interface
	  Association Descriptor (IAD)
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_i2c.c: Correct a typo in STM32 I2C3 support
	  (submitted by Mike Smith)
	* arch/*/src/Makefile:  Candidate solution for dependency issue in the board
	  sub-directory:  By making libboard.a a "phony" target, libboard.a should
	  always rebuilt (the end result is worth the small increase in build time)
	  (submitted by Mike Smith).
	* include/net/psock.h:  Added a new low level socket interface that allows the
	  OS to use the socket interface without having a socket descriptor.
	* include/net/psock.h: Removed psock.h.  The new interfaces are moved into
	  nuttx/net.h which already has similar logic.
	* include/nuttx/usb/usb.h: Can't use 'class' as a field name in USB structures.
	  This upsets C++ if usb.h is included. 'class' -> 'classid' in this header
	  file and all places that referenced 'class'
	* drivers/usbdev/usbmsc.c: Fixed some backward conditional compilation.
	* sched/on_exit.c:  Add support for the on_exit() function.,
	* sched/exit.c, task_exithook.c, task_delete.c, sched_releasetcb.c:  Move
	  the logic that closes file descriptors sooner in the task shutdown sequence.
	  When drivers are closed, they may need to do things that require a fully
	  up-and-running task.  Some things cannot be done later when the task is
	  crippled.
	* lib/dirent: Moved readdir_r() and telldir() from lib/misc to this new
	  directory where they belong.
	* lib/termios.  Implemented tcsetattr() and tcgetattr().
	* lib/stdio/lib_fgets.c:  The old fgets includes some terminal related
	  functionality:  It handles VT-100 commands, includes a command line editor
	  and echo characters back to the terminal.  This old, overloaded fgets()
	  was renamed readline() and moved to apps/system/readline.  The version
	  of fgets() in lib/stdio was them simplified and stripped down so that it
	  *only* gets a string -- as its description implies.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc214x/lpc214x_usbdev.c:  Add corrections suggested by
	  David Hewson many, many months ago.
	* configs/mcu123-lpc214x/composite and configs/mcu123-lpc214x/src/up_composite.c:
	  Add a configuration to test the USB composite device.
	* configs/stm3240g-eval/Telnetd:  Add a configuration for testing the
	  Telnet daemon.
	* configs/stm3240g-eval/nsh2:  This is another NSH configuration.  It differs
	  from the original nsh configuration because it does not have an RS-232
	  console (only a Telnet console) and SDIO is enabled.  This configuration is
	  required because the STM3240G-EVAL board cannot simultaneously support
	  RS-232 and SDIO due to pin conflicts.
	* lib/string/lib_strcasestr.c:  Add strcasestr().
	* lib/stdio/lib_avsprintf.c:  Add avsprintf().
	* lib/net/lib_inetntop.c:  Add inet_ntop().
	* lib/net/lib_inetpton.c:  Add inet_pton().
	* include/pthread.h:  Correct PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER.
	* fs/fat/fs_fatfs.c:  Fix an error in the FAT statfs() implementation that
	  was causing some block counts to be reported incorrectly (reported by
	  David Sidrane).
	* drivers/ramlog.c:  Add a character driver that can substitute
	  for /dev/console and or be used for logging debug output when there
	  is no serial port available (such as when a Telnet console is used).
	* lib/stdio/lib_syslogstream:  Add a stream object that will be used to
	  re-direct all debug output to the RAM log if CONFIG_SYSLOG and
	  CONFIG_RAMLOG_SYSLOG are defined.
	* lib/misc/lib_dbg.c: Add an interface enabled with CONFIG_DEBUG_ENABLE that
	  can be used to turn debug output on and off.

6.16 2012-03-10 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* drivers/sensors/qencoder.c and include/nuttx/sensors/qencoder.h:  Add an
	  implementation for a quadrature encoder upper half driver.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_qencoder.c/.h:  Add a initial implementation of
	  a lower-half quadrature encoder driver for the STM32.  On initial check-in,
	  this is little more than a "skeleton" file.
	* Various files:  CAN ISO-11783 support contributed by Gary Teravskis.
	* net/recv.c and net/recvfrom.c: Correct a bug in return value:  The the peer
	  gracefully closes the connections, needs to return zero and not ENOTCONN.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_eth.c:  Fix an error in the STM32 ethernet driver.
	  The received buffer size must be two bytes larger to account for the two byte
	  checksum that is appended to the packet.  Otherwise, the last two bytes of
	  real data in the packet will get clobbered.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32f40xx_dma.c:  The STM32 F4 DMA has (finally) been verified
	* arch/arm/src/stm32_sdio.c:  STM32 F4 SDIO DMA is now supported
	* configs/stm3240g-eval/nsh/defconfig: This configuration now supports SDIO
	  with DMA (see configs/stm3240g-eval/README.txt for some issues).
	* arch/arm/src/armv7-m/up_vectors.S and arch/arm/src/armv7-m/up_vectors.S:  New,
	  streamlined Cortex-M exception handling (with FPU supported).  Contributed byh
	  Mike Smith
	* net/accept.c, connect.c,and net_monitor.c:  Correct an error in the accept
	  logic.  After a new connection is made via accept(), monitoring for losses
	  of TCP connection must be set up (just as with connect()).  The new file
	  net_monitor.c holds the common TCP connection monitoring logic used by both
	  the accecpt() and connect() logic.  Contributed by Max Nekludov.
	* net/recvfrom.c and net/uip/uip_tcpcallback.c:  Fix a leak in the TCP
	  read-ahead logic.  This is a *critical* bug fix!
	* net/uip/uip_tcpinput.c:  Correct an error in the TCP stack.  It was
	  incrementing the received sequence number BEFORE determining if the
	  incoming data could be handled.  If the data was dropped (usually because
	  there is insufficient buffering space), then no ACK will be sent and the
	  sequence number will be wrong.  The end consequence of the bad sequence
	  number was that the when the dropped packet was re-transmitted, it was
	  was ignored because its sequence number looked wrong.  Fix was, obviously,
	  to only increment the recevied sequence number if the TCP data was
	  accepted.
	* configs/stm3240g-eval, configs/stm32f40discovery, and arch/*/src/Makefile:
	  Add changes to support building with the Atollic "Lite" toolchain.
	* fs/fs_select.c:  Correct select(), in the case of loss of network
	  connection (POLLHUP), select() must report a read-ready event.  This
	  is how the standard select() interface is supposed to work:  In the case
	  of loss-of-connection, select() reports read-ready.  The next time you
	  read from the socket, you detect the end-of-connection event.  Change
	  submitted by Max Nekludov.
	* arch/arm/src/armv7-m/up_fpu.S and arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_vectors.S:  Fix
	  lazy FPU register saving with CONFIG_ARCH_FPU is set in the configuration.
	* arch/arm/src/armv7-m:  Lazy saving of floating point registers on context
	  switches now seems to be functional.
	* net/uip/uip_tcpinput.c:  Fix a TCP protocol error reported by Max Nekludov.
	* configs/stm3240g-eval, configs/stm32f40discovery:  Add changes to support
	  building with the Atollic "Pro" toolchain.
	* Makefile:  Use the more common .hex extension for Intel hex files instead of
	  more precise .ihx extension.  This change has ripple effects to many build-
	  related scripts and programs and could cause some short-term problems.
	* configs/stm3240g-eval/, arch/arm/src/stm32/up_allocateheap.c:  Add support
	  for the 16-mbit SRAM on-board the STM3240G-EVAL board.
	* drivers/usbdev/cdcacm.c and include/nuttx/usbdev/cdcacm.h:  The CDC/ACM
	  driver can now be dynamically connected and disconnected from the host
	  under software control.
	* include/nuttx/arch.h, configs/stm3240g-eval/src/up_cxxinitialize.c, and
	  configs/stm3240g-eval/src/up_cxxinitialize.c:  Add support for C++ static
	  initializers.
	* net/setsockopt.c, net/getsockopt.c, net/bind.c, net/socket.c:  Add more
	  low level, thread-independent socket interfaces for use within the OS.
	  Some of these are currently used by the FTP controlling terminal.  More will
	  be used to support the NFS file system currenly underwork.
	* include/nuttx/net/:  Major re-organization of networking headerf files.
	  Moved all non-standard, NuttX-specific header files from include/net and
	  include/nuttx into include/nuttx/net.
	* arch/mips/src/pic32mx/pic32mx_usbdev.c:  The PIC32 USB driver now appears to
	  be fully functional.
	* configs/sure-pic32mx/usbnsh and configs/sure-pic32mx/src:  Add support for
	  NSH using only USB serial I/O to support the console.  This is useful on
	  devices that have USB, but no serial port.
	* arch/mips/src/pic32mx/pic32mx_spi.c:  Add a PIC32 SPI driver.  Initial
	  checkin is primitive, incomplete (lacks interrupt logic), and untested.
	* configs/pic32-startkit/nsh:  Completed verification of the PIC32 Ethernet
	  Starter Kit port.  Added and verified the NuttShell (NSH) on the PIC32
	  Ethernet Starter Kit.  I can now (finally) claim to have complete the
	  basic port to this board.
	* configs/pic32-startkit/nsh/up_usbdev, up_nsh.c, and up_usbterm.c:  Verified
	  the USB (device) driver on the PIC32 Ethernet Starter Kit.
	* arch/mips/src/pic32mx/pic32mx_ethernet.c:  Verified the PIC32 Ethernet
	  driver on the PIC32 Starter Kit.  Status:  It is occasionally functional
	  but not stable enough for use.
	* arch/arm/include/stm32, arch/arm/src/stm32:  Add general support for
	  the STM32 F2 family. Contributed by Gary Teravskis,
	* configs/stm3220g-eval:  Add support for the STMicro STM3220G-EVAL board.
	  Contributed by Gary Teravskis,

6.17 2012-04-14 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* configs/sure-pic32mx: Add support for the Sure DB-DP11212 PIC32 General
	  Purpose Demo Board
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_usbhost.c/.h:  Add files that will (eventually)
	  hold an STM32 USB host driver (the initial check-in is the NuttX LPC17
	  USB host driver with name changes only).
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/chip/stm32_otgfs.h:  STM32 USB OTG FS register
	  definitions (not complete on initial check-in).
	* net/connect.c:  Add another low level, thread-independent socket interface
	  for use within the OS.
	* arch/mips/src/pic32mx/pic32mx_ethernet.c:  The PIC32 Ethernet driver
	  is now stable on the PIC32 Starter Kit.
	* configs/pic32-starterkit/nsh2:  Add a PIC32 Ethernet Starter Kit NSH
	  configuration that has no serial console; all interaction is done via
	  Telnet.
	* net/netdev_sem.c:  Correct a deadlock condition by making a seamphore
	  recursive.  To my knowledge this deadlock only occurs when running the
	  NSH command ifconfig over Telnet.  In that case the function netdev_foreach
	  takes the network device semaphore, but so does the telnet logic causing
	  the deadlock.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_pm*.c: Add basic STM32 power management logic
	  that will eventually be used to implement low power states.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32f*0xx_rcc.c:  In order to use CAN2, both CAN1 and
	  CAN2 clocking must be enabled.
	* arch/mips/src/pic32mx/picm32mx-usbdev.c:  Several stall-related fixes so that
	  the USB device driver can used the the mass storage class (which does a LOT
	  of stalling as part of its normal protocol).  The PIC32 USB Mass Storage
	  device is, however, still non-functional when debug is OFF.
	* include/nuttx/fs: Move all file-system related files from include/nuttx to
	  include/nuttx/fs.
	* include/nuttx/serial: Move all serial-driver related files from include/nuttx to
	  include/nuttx/serial.
	* include/nuttx/clock.h and sched/clock_initialize.c:  Add a new OS interface
	  called clock_sychronize() that can be used to re-synchronize the NuttX
	  system time with a hardware RTC.  This function is called normally at power
	  up but may also need to be called when recovering from certain low-power
	  usage states where the system time is no longer accurate.
	* arch/arm/src/calypso and arch/arm/include/calypso: Support for the TI "Calypso"
	  phone processor. Contributed by Denis Carilki and includes the work of Denis,
	  Alan Carvalho de Assis, and Stefan Richter.
	* configs/compal_e88 and configs/compal_e99:  Support for Compal e88 and e99 phones
	  Contributed by Denis Carilki and includes the work of Denis, Alan Carvalho de
	  Assis, and Stefan Richter.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx: Several fixes for error that have crept in for the LPC17xx
	  DAC.  Contributed by by Lzyy.
	* graphics/nxconsole:  Add a character driver that can be used as a console output
	  device for text output (still under development on initial check-in).
	* graphics/nxmu:  Fix several compilation errors that have crept into the multi-
	  user NX server because of lack of use.
	* graphics/nxconsole:  The NX text console is basically function (in multi-
	  user NX mode only).
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_i2c.c: Correct a bug in the STM32 I2C driver.  The
	  behavior of I2C status bits seems to be different between F1 and F4.
	* configs/stm3210e-eval/nxconsole:  New STM32 F1 configuration that runs the
	  NuttShell (NSH) within an NX window.
	* graphics/nxconsole/nxcon_sem.c:  Add protection from re-entrance with debug
	  is enabled.
	* include/nuttx/ascii.h and vt100.h:  Header files to centralize ASCII and
	  VT100 escape sequence definitions.
	* graphics/nxconsole/nxcon_vt100.c:  Add add framework to support VT100 escape
	  sequences in NxConsole.
	* fs/fs_read.c:  Fix read() return value for attempt to read from write-only
	  file or device.  Was returning EBADF, should return EACCES.
	* graphics/nxconsole.c:  NxConsole now supports backspace and a cursor.
	* Kconfig and arch/sim/Kconfig:  Beginnings of support for a NuttX
	  configuration tool.  Currently using the kconfig parser 'kconfig-frontend'
	  available at http://ymorin.is-a-geek.org/projects/kconfig-frontends
	  (version 3.3.0-1 is also available in the NuttX SVN at
	  trunk/misc/tools/kconfig-frontends-3.3.0-1.tar.gz).  Contributed by Lzyy.
	* */Kconfig:  Added skeleton Kconfig files to all directories that
	  may need them.
	* include/nuttx/math.h:  Moved include/math.h to include/nuttx/math.h
	  because it conflicts too often with the system math.h (and people aren't
	  inclined to read the documentation on how to handle this).  Now, if
	  CONFIG_ARCH_MATH_H=y is defined, the top-level makefile will copy
	  the redirecting math.h header file from include/nuttx/math.h to
	  include/math.h.  So for the architectures that define CONFIG_ARCH_MATH_H=y,
	  include/math.h will be in place as it was before; for the architectures
	  that don't select CONFIG_ARCH_MATH_H, the redirecting math.h header
	  file will stay out-of-the-way in include/nuttx/.
	* Kconfig, sched/Kconfig, lib/Kconfig, libxx/Kconfig, arch/sim/Kconfig,
	  drivers/Kconfig, drivers/mtd/Kconfig, drivers/input/Kconfig
	  drivers/analog/Kconfig, drivers/lcd/Kconfig:  Updated kernel
	  configuration support provided by Lzyy.
	* Kconfig:  Many more Kconfig updates (no longer tracking in the ChangeLog)
	* arch/arm/src/Makefile, arch/x86/src/Makefile, arch/avr/src/Makefile,
	  arch/mips/src/Makefile, arch/sim/src/Makefile, arch/hc/src/Makefile,
	  arch/sh/src/Makefile:  The libgcc.a in newer versions of GCC now
	  have an dependency on an external implementation of abort().  This
	  required modification to the Makefiles that do the final link:  Now
	  libgcc.a must be included within the group of libraries that are
	  search recursively.
	* arch/arm/srm/stm32/stm32_otgfsdev.c:  A USB OTG FS device-side driver
	  for the STM32 F4 (and maybe F2 and F1 connectivity line).
	* tools/cmpconfig.c:  A tool for comparing two configuration files.
	* include/nuttx/usb/usbdev.h, drivers/usbdev/*, arch/*/src/*/*usb*.c:
	  Extend the USB device side interface so that EP0 OUT data can be passed
	  with OUT SETUP requests.
	* include/nuttx/watchdog.h:  Add the definition of a standard watchdog
	  driver interface.
	* drivers/watchdog.c:  The "upper half" watchdog timer driver.

6.18 2012-05-19 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* Kconfig:  Continued Kconfig file updates (no longer tracking on a per-file
	  basis in the ChangeLog)
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_iwdog.c and stm32_wwdog.c:  Add the STM32 IWDG
	  and WWDIG watchdog timer driver.
	* configs/stm3240g-eval/src/up_lcd.c: Add LCD from for the STM3240G-EVAL (the
	  initial check-in is just a stm3210e-eval driver with renaming).
	* sched/sched_setscheduler.c:  Correct successful return value (Contributed
	  by Richard Cochran).
	* include/fcntl.h and lib/stdio:  Ignore CONFIG_STDIO_LINEBUFFER is the
	  file was opened in binary mode.
	* lib/stdio/lib_fopen.c:  Correct an error in parsing open mode string.  The
	  plus sign may not appear right after the basic mode.  For example, "r+", "rb+",
	  and "r+b" are all valid open strings and mean the same thing.
	* lib/stdio/lib_fopen.c:  Correct return errno value from f_open() and
	  f_fdopen() if the open mode string is invalid.
	* drivers/serial/serial.c:  Do not disable Rx interrupts on each byte.
	  Rather, only disable Rx interrupts when the Rx ring buffer may be empty.
	* include/nuttx/usb/audio.h:  USB Audio 1.0 definitions (in progress).
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32fxx_dma.c:  STM32 F4 DMA now supports circular
	  buffer mode (contributed by Mike Smith)
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_serial.c:  The serial driver can now support
	  Rx DMA into a circular buffer (contributed by Mike Smith)
	* configs/pic32mx7mmb: Beginning of a configuration for the Mikroelektronka
	  PIC32MX7 Multimedia Board (MMB).
	* net/recvfrom.c:  Fix a compilation problem.  Some UDP logic was conditioned
	  on TCP, not UDP.
	* drivers/usbdev/cdcacm.c: Fix an infinite loop that occurs when the serial
	  device is unregisters.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_otgfs.c: The driver needs to reset the software (in
	  order to flush the requests) and to disable the software connection when the
	  device is unregistered.
	* include/sys/prctl.h, sched/prctl.c, include/pthread.h:  Add interfaces to
	  support getting and setting of the thread or task name.
	* configs/ubw32:  Added a configuration to support the Sparkfun UBW32 PIC32 board.
	* configs/ubw32/nsh:  Added an NSH configuration for the Sparkfun UBW32 PIC32 board.
	* configs/ubw32/up_buttons.c:  Added button support for Bit Whacker board.
	* configs/stm3240g-eval/nxconsole:  Added a configuration to run the NSH
	  shell in an NX window for the STM3240G-EVAL board.
	* include/cxx/cunistd:  C++ header file to make sure that everything in
	  unistd.h is in the std:: namespace.
	* configs/sim/nxwm:  Added a configuration for testing the NuttX Window Manager
	  (NxWM)
	* fs/fs_fcntl.h:  On success, always returned OK.  However, some fcntl commands
	  require returning other values on success.
	* Various files.  Fix warnings about variables that were initialized by not used.
	* configs/sim/*/defconfig:  Changes to build a 32-bit simulation on a 32-bit
	  platform did not make into all of the Make.defs files.
	* graphics/nxmu/nx_move.c:  Wrong opcode was being used in the server message;
	  Also there was an error in the offset calculation.
	* graphics/nxglib/fb/nxglib_moverectangle.c:  Offset argument is really a 
	  position, not an offset.
	* graphics/nxtk/nxtk_drawframe.c:  Framed windows are now drawn in three
	  colors (instead of just two).
	* drivers/input/stmpe811_*:  Added a driver to support the STMicro STMPE811
	  IO Expander and touchscreen driver.
	* configs/stm3240g-eval/nxwm:  Added to configuration for testing the NxWM
	  window manager on the STM3240G-EVAL board.
	* graphics/nxtk/nxtk_toolbarbounds.c:  Added an interface to get the toolbar
	  bounding box.
	* graphics/nxtk/nxtk_drawframe.c:  Fix an error in drawing the window frame.
	* NX, NxConsole:  Replace CONFIG_NXCONSOLE_NOGETRUN to CONFIG_LCD_GETRUN.  The
	  inability to read from the LCD is a property of the LCD, not of NxConsole.
	  Then add CONFIG_NX_WRITEONLY which is the more generic way of saying that
	  no NX component should try to read from the underlying graphic device (LCD
	  or other).
	* configs/stm3240g-eval/src/up_stmpe811.c:  Add board-specific support for the
	  the STMPE811 I/O expander on the STM3240G-EVAL board.  Verfied that the
	  STM3240G-EVAL touchscreen is now fully functional.
	* include/cxx/cfcntl:  Added std:: header file.
	* graphics/nxbe/nxbe_filltrapezoid.c and graphics/nxglib/fb/nxglib_filltrapezoid.c:
	  Fix several errors in the trapezoid fill logic.
	* include/nuttx/input/touchscreen.h, configs/hymini-stm32, configs/stm3240g-evel,
	* configs/sam3u-ek, configs/sim, arch/sim/src/up_touchscreen.c, and
	  apps/examples/touchscreen: Standardize the board-specific, touchscreen
	  initialization interfaces.
	* drivers/input/stmpe811_base.c and configs/stm3240g-eval:  The STMPE811-based
	  touchscreen seems to work better with edge (vs. level) interrupts
	* drivers/input/stmpe811_tsc.c:  Fix some status checks so that the touchscreen
	  interrupt handling logic does not read data if the fifo is not at the
	  threshold level.
	* include/nuttx/wqueue.h: Add macro work_available() to determine if the
	  previously scheduled work has completed.
	* drivers/stmpe811_tsc.c:  Correct errors: (1) Since all interrupt logic is done on
	  the worker thread, disabling interrupts does not provide protected; Need to
	  disable pre-emption.  (2) Fix handling of touch ID and (2) add some logic to
	  prevent certain kinds of data overrun.
	* include/nx/nxtk.h and graphics/nx/nxtk/nxtk_internal.h:  Move setting
	  of configuration defaults from the internal header file to a place where
	  other logic can use the defaults.
	* graphics/nxtk/nxtk_events.c:  Fixed an important but in the logic that
	  translates the mouse/touchscreen position data for framed windows and toolbars.
	* drivers/input/stmpe811_tsc.c, tsc2007.c, and ads7843e.c:  Need to keep track of
	  when if positional data is valid.  When the touch is released, the X/Y position
	  of the release must be the same as the X/Y position of the last touch (se that
	  the release occurs in the same window as the last touch).
	* graphics/nxtk/nxtk_events.c:  Fix an error in mouse/touchscreen input logic:
	  Was autoraising the window AFTER processing the mouse press.  This raises havoc
	  if the result of processing the mouse click was to raise some other window!
	* graphics/nxtk/nxtk_events.c:  I had to disable the whole autoraise feature
	  for multi-user case because it does not work correctly.  In a scenario where (1) there
	  are multiple queued touchscreen events for the same window and (2) the result of the
	  first input was to switch windows, then the autoraise implementation will cause the
	  window to revert to the previous window.  Not good behavior.
	* sched/sched_mergepending.c:  Add task switching instrumentation.  There is a case
	  here where instrumentation was missing.  Contributed by Petri Tanskanen.
	* CONFIG_STMPE811_THRESHX, CONFIG_STMPE811_THRESHX, and drivers/stmpe811_tsc.c:  Add some
	  thresholding controls to all slow down processing of touchscreen samples.
	  This is a problem with NX in multi-user mode:  touchscreen data gets sent
	  via a message and when the message queue gets full the sender blocks and
	  touch events are lost.  Basic data overrun.  The badly effects touchscreen
	  human factors.
	* include/sched.h:  Fix a typo (missing semicolon) in prototype of on_exit();
	* sched/on_exit.c and include/nuttx/sched.h:  Fix some old typos that caused
	  compilation errors when CONFIG_SCHED_ONEXIT is defined.
	* configs/stm3240g-eval/nxwm/defconfig:  The default NxWM now uses the STMPE811
	  touchscreen.
	* include/cxx/csched: Added
	* graphic/nxmu/nxmu_sendserver.c, nxmu_sendwindow.c, and nxmu_sendclient.c:
	  Refactor NX messaging logic in preparation for a new message control
	  feature.
	* graphics/nxtk, graphics/nxmu, include/nuttx/nx:  Add a new window communication
	  to support blocking and flushing of client window messages.  If there are
	  stale, queue window messages at the time that a window is destroyed, very bad
	  things happen.

6.19 2012-06-15 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* graphics/nxconsole/nxcon_kbdin.c:  If selected, the NxConsole will take
	  input from the NX keyboard input callback.  If this option is set, then
	  the interface nxcon_kdbin() is enabled.  That interface may be driven by
	  window callback functions so that keyboard input *only* goes to the top
	  window. If CONFIG_NXCONSOLE_NXKBDIN is not selected, then the NxConsole
	  will receive its input from stdin (/dev/console).  This works great but
	  cannot be shared between different windows.  Chaos will ensue if you
	  try to support multiple NxConsole windows without CONFIG_NXCONSOLE_NXKBDIN
	* graphics/nxmu/nx_kbdin.c:  Fix pointer argument.  This is a error
	  introduced in changes leading up to the 6.18 release.  This error will
	  cause crashes or perhaps simply not work when you try to handle window
	  keyboard data in multi-user mode.
	* graphics/nxconsole/nxcon_kdbind.c:  Fixed unmatched sem_wait and sem_post.
	  Fix some conditional compilation that included a few too many lines of code.
	* drivers/input/stmpe811_tsc.c and stmpe811.h:  Add a timeout to catch missed
	  pen up events.  Now the STM3240G-EVAL touchscreen works very smoothly.
	* configs/stm3240g-eval/nxwm/defconfig: Enable support for NxConsole keyboard
	  input. Increasing spacing of icons.
	* configs/stm3240g-eval/nxwm/defconfig: Use a larger font for the calculator.
	* include/nuttx/lcd/ssd1289.h, drivers/lcd/ssd1289.c and .h:  Generic LCD
	  driver for LCDs based on the Solomon Systech SSD1289 LCD driver.  This
	  of this as a template for an LCD driver that will have to be cusomized
	  for your particular LCD hardware.
	* configs/stm32f4discovery/src/up_extmem.c and up_ssd1289.c:  Add support to
	  STM32F4Discovery for than an external, SSD1289-based LCD.
	* configs/stm32f4discovery/nxlines:  Add an STM32F4Discovery configuration
	  to thest the SSD1289-based LCD.
	* configs/stm3240g-eval/src: Add USB GPIO initialization logic needed
	  in board-specific boot logic.
	* configs/stm32f4discovery/src: Add USB GPIO initialization logic needed
	  in board-specific boot logic.
	* drivers/usbdev/pl2303.c and cdcacm.c:  Fix the request size used for sending
	  packets.  It was not using the maximum request size, but instead the previous
	  request size.  As a result, packets get smaller, and smaller, and ...  This
	  is an important USB serial fix.
	* arch/arc/src/stm32_otgfsdev.c: Bug fix: Don't process TXFE if we have
	  already processed an XFRC interrupt.  We have already done what needs
	  to done in that case.
	* arch/arc/src/stm32_otgfsdev.c:  Fixed some status settings in queuing of write
	  messages. Added a "hack" to work around missing TxFIFO empty interrupts.  The
	  hack is basically to poll for space in the TxFIFO instead of of setting up
	  the interrupt.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32f2* and chip/stm32f2*:  Update all STM32 F2 file so
	  that they are equivalent to F4 files.  This is kind of a maintenance nightmare.
	* configs/stm3220g-eval/: Update existing configurations to the same level
	  as the corresponding STM3240G-EVAL configurations.  This adds FSMC SRAM,
	  touchscreen, and LCD support.
	* configs/stm3220g-eval/: Add a NxWM configuration for the STM3220G-EVAL.
	* stmpe11*: Fix a massive naming problem.  All references to STMPE11 should be
	  STMPE812.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_otgfsdev.c: Need to enabled USB reset interrupt
	  (contributed by Erik Van Der Zalm).
	* sched/sleep.c:  Fix the return value from sleep().  The correct behavior is
	  to return the number of unwaited seconds; the implementation was always
	  returning zero.
	* sched/usleep.c and include/unistd.h:  Was a void function, but should return
	  0 on success.  usleep() needs to check the return value from sigtimedwait().
	  sigtimewait() returns the signal number that awakened it and an error (EAGAIN)
	  if the timeout expired (normal case).
	* sched/sig_timedwait.c:  Fix sigtimedwait() return value.  On a timeout, it was
	  setting the 8-bit si_signo field to -1 and eded up reported successfully awakened
	  by signal 255!  Now detects the timeout and errors -1 with errno == EGAIN.  If
	  sigtimedwait() is awakened by an unblocked signal, but it is not one of the
	  signals in the waited-for set, it will return -1 with errno == EINTR.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32_i2c.c:  Fix STM32 F2 I2C.  It is apparently bug-for-bug
	  compatible with the F4 and needs the same work-around for the missing BTF
	  signal that was needed for the F4.
	* drivers/lcd/ssd1289.*:  Fix some of the initial register settings.
	* configs/stm32f4discovery/src/up_ssd1289.c: FSMC address bit 16 is used to
	  distinguish command and data.  But FSMC address bits 0-24 correspond to ARM
	  address bits 1-25, se we need to set bit 17 in order generate output on
	  FSMC_A16.
	* arch/arm/src/lm3s/lm3s_epi.h and lm3s_timer.h:  LM3S header files
	  (contributed by Max Neklyudov).
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_irq.c:  Some of the interrupt priorities were
	  not be initialized (F2 and F4 only).  Thus, the very high numbered
	  interrupts (like UART6) and cause nested interrupts.  This leads to
	  some very difficult to debug crashes.  Fix contributed by Mike Smith.
	* arch/mips/src/pic32/pic32_head.S and pic32_config.h and
	  configs/pic32mx7mmb/include/board.h:  Extended PIC32 device configuration
	  capabilities and change board.h to support unique clocking requirements
	  of the Mikroelektronika PIC32MX7 MMB.  That board now works!
	* configs/pic32mx7mmb/nsh:  Added and verify a NuttShell configuration
	  for the Mikroelektronika PIC32MX7 MMB board.
	* arch/mips/pic32/pic32mx-ethernet.c:  Fix logic that guesses PHY address;
	  the search loop missed the PHY address needed by the Mikroelektronika
	  PIC32MX7 MMB board.
	* configs/pic32mx7mmb/nsh:  Configuration now supports a network by default.
	* configs/pic32mx7mmb/src:  Add support for the MMC/SD slot on board
	  the Mikroelektronika PIC32MX7 MMB board (not working on initial check-in).
	* arch/mips/src/pic32/pic32mx-spi.c:  Add support for very low-level,
	  register access debug output.
	* configs//pic32mx7mmb/include/board.h:  Reduced peripheral clock to
	  4MHz to match other PIC32 configurations.
	* configs/pic32mx7mmb/src/up_nsh.c:  SD card needs to operate in SPI
	  mode 2.
	* configs/pic32mx7mmb/nsh/defconfig:  MMC/SD card support is now
	  enabled by default in the PIC32MX7 MMB board configuration.
	* configs/pic32mx7mmb/nsh/defconfig:  Verified the USB Mass Storage
	  Class (MSC) using MMC/SD card as the logical unit.  Updated the default
	  PIC32MX7 MMB board configuration so that USB and the mass storage class
	  are enabled by default.
	* drivers/lcd/mio283qt2.c and include/nuttx/lcd/mio283qt2.h:  Add generic
	  support for the MIO283QT2 LCD.
	* configs/pic32mx7mmb/src/up_mio283qt2.c:  Add support for the MIO283QT2
	  LCD on the PIC32MX7 MMB board.
	* configs/pic32mx7mmb/src/up_touchscreen.c:  Add an ADC-based touchscreen
	  driver for the PIC32MX7 MMB board.  Kind of works, but needs more
	  verification and tuning.
	* arch/mips/src/common/up_idle.c:  Strange but important fix.  For some still-
	  unknown reason, interrupts are left in an unhealthy state in the IDLE
	  when the work queue is enabled.  This is partially because some interrupt
	  related logic is not built in that case.  Simply disabling then re-
	  enabling interrupts restores the proper state.
	* graphics/nxglib/lcd/nxglib_filltrapezoid.c and fb/nxglib_filltrapezoid.c:
	  Fix an error when the trapezoid is only 1 line high.  In this case, a
	  divide by zero error would occur.  The fix is to draw the 1 line high
	  trapezoid as a run.
	* drivers/usbdev/pl2303.c:  Fix a cut'n'paste error that snuck into
	  the PL2303 emulation driver several months back.

6.20 2012-07-12 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* configs/stm3210e-eval/src and arch/arm/src/stm32/: Add beginnings of
	  power management support for the STM32 and the STM3210E-EVAL board, in
	  particular.
	* Documentation/NfsHowTo.html:  Add a How-To document for the new NFS
	  client feature.
	* arch/mips/include/pic32mx and arch/mips/src/pic32mx:  Add support for the
	  PIC32MX1 and PIC32MX2 families.
	* configs/mirtoo:  Add a board configuration to support the DTX1-4000L
	  "Mirtoo" module from http://www.dimitech.com/
	* tools/pic32mx:  All of the duplicate directories containing the same
	  same PIC32 tools were move to this single location.
	* configs/mirtoo:  The basic Mirtoo port is now functional.
	* configs/mirtoo/ostest:  Added support for the microchipOpen toolchain
	  (see http://sourceforge.net/projects/microchipopen/).
	* configs/mirtoo/nsh:  Added a NuttShell (NSH) configuration for
	  the Mirtoo module.
	* configs/mirtoo/scripts:  Move all Mirtoo linker scripts to a common
	  directory.
	* arch/mips/src/pic32mx/pic32mx-gpio.c:  All digital inputs were being
	  configured as outputs.  This is a *critical* bug fix and needs to be
	  incorporated by any PIC32 users.
	* drivers/mtd/sst25.c:  Added a driver for the SST 25 SPI-based FLASH
	  parts.
	* configs/mirtoo/src/up_nsh.c:  The Mirtoo NSH configuration can now
	  mount the SST 25 devices so that it can be used for a FAT file system.
	  There are are, however, some NSH memory usage issues if this configuration
	  enabled now.  Some tuning is still needed.
	* configs/mirtoo/nxffs:  Add an alternative NSH configure for the Mirtoo
	  module for testing the on-module SST 25 chip using the NXFFS file system.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc43xx and arch/arm/include/lpc43xx:  The NXP LPC43xx port
	  is slowly evolving in these directories.
	* configs/stm3210e-eval/pm:  Add a new configuration for testing STM32 power
	  management.
	* configs/stm3210e-eval/scripts:  Moved all of the duplicate ST3210-EVAL 
	  linker scripts into one set of linker scripts at this location.
	* configs/stm3210e-eval/src/up_buttons.c, up_lcd.c, and up_pm.c:  New logic
	  for testing STM32 power management.
	* configs/lincoln60:  Add a configuration to support the Micromint Lincoln60
	  board.
	* configs/ekk-lm3s3b96:  Add a configuration to support the TI/Stellaris
	  EKK-LM3S3B96 development board.  Contributed by Jose Pablo Rojas V.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc43xx/chip:  Created header files for *all* (really)
	  lpc43xx registers and all bit-fields.
	* configs/lpc4330-xplorer:  Added a configuration for the NXP LPC43XX
	  Xplorer board.  This is just to facilitate testing of the LPC43xx
	  port but will, with any luck, become proper board support for that
	  board.
	* arch/arm/src/lm3s/lm3s_syscontrol.c:  Fix an optimization related problem
	  by adding a volatile qualifier to a timing loop.  Oddly, the consequence
	  of the bug is that when debug was off, the LM3S platform too a long time
	  to boot.  It now boots rapidly whether debug is on or off.
	* arch/*/include/limits.h:  Change all values in all limits.h for all
	  architectures to signed decimal; the hex values were not sign extending
	  appropriate in most uses (reported by Lorenz Meier).
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/chip/stm32f103/7vc_pinmap:  Fix typographical error in
	  two pinmap definition files.
	* lib/net/lib_inetntoa.c:  Fix typographical error that cause compilation
	  failure on platforms that do not support passing of structures as
	  parameters.
	* arch/arm/*/lpc43xx and configs/lpc4330-xplorer and code complete and
	  ready for testing.  Hopefully, verified LPC43xx support will appear
	  in NuttX-6.20.
	* include/nuttx/stdarg.h:  If CONFIG_ARCH_STDARG_H=y is defined, the top-level
	  makefile will copy the generic (GCC-only) stdarg.h header file from
	  include/nuttx/stdarg.h to include/stdarg.h.  So for the architectures
	  that cannot use their GCC toolchain's stdarg.h file, they can use this
	  alternative by defining CONFIG_ARCH_STDARG_H=y.  If CONFIG_ARCH_STDARG_H,
	  is not defined, then the redirecting stdarg.h header file will stay
	  out-of-the-way in include/nuttx/.
	* configs/lpc4330-xplorer/nsh:  Add an NSH configuration for the LPC4330
	  Xplorer board.

6.21 2012-08-25 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* configs/lpc4330-xplorer/up_nsh.c:  Add support for a basic SPIFI block
	  driver for use by NSH.  Does not work!  Crashes on first SPIFI write.
	* configs/lpc4330-xplorer/*/defconfig: Calibrate delay loops (this is
	  based on the current "slow" 72MHz M4 clock and will need to be
	  re-calibrated when this is increased).
	* configs/stm3220g-eval/include/board.h and configs/stm3240g-eval/include/board.h:
	  The SDIOCLK frequency in the F2 and F4 derives for PLL48CLK and not HCLK
	  so that the SDIOCLK input frequency should always be 48MHz.
	* sched/os_internal.h, sched_setupidlefiles.c, sched_setuptaskfiles.c, and
	  sched_setupidlefiles.c:  Detangle some conditional compilation.  Allow for
	  a perverse configuration that has socket descriptors and streams but no file
	  descriptors (sure, why not?).
	* sched/: Stylistic clean-up of all files.  Some of these files are pretty old
	  and do not follow current NuttX coding standards in detail.
	* fs/: More stylistic file clean-up.
	* mm/: More stylistic file clean-up.
	* drivers/ and drivers/serial/: More stylistic file clean-up.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc43xx/lpc43_clockconfig.c:  Fix PLL1 bit manipulation logic.
	  Critical bugfix! This would often cause the LPC43xx to fail to boot.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc43xx/lpc43_rgu.c:  The soft reset logic called from the
	  beginning of __start seems cause problems.  A magic delay seems to improve
	  the logic some.  But I suspect that real fix is to get rid of all of the
	  soft reset logic.  This would also be a critical bugfix if I believed
	  that it really fixed all of the issues.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc43xx/chip/lpc43_cgu.h:  Fix a bit mask in the PLL1
	  control register.  Critical bugfix.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc43xx/lpc43_clockconfig.c and configs/lpc4330-xplorer/include/board.h:
	  Implement PLL1 ramp-up logic; Now the LPC43xx is running at 204MHz.
	* configs/lpc4330-xplorer/*/defconfig:  Re-calibrated delay loops using
	  the 204MHz clock.  The LPC43xx ripping rips!  This calibration was performed
	  with symbols enabled and all optimization disabled.  It will need to be
	  better recalibrated again down the road.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_exti.c:  Renamed to rch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_exti_gpio.c
	  to make a little room in the file name space.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_exti_alarm.c:  Add initial logic to attached the
	  RTC alarm EXTI interrupt.  This is work be performed mostly by Diego Sanchez.
	* include/: More stylistic file clean-up.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc43xx/lpc43_spifi.c, lpc43_spifi.h, and chip/lpc43_spifi.h:  Add
	  logic to configure and initialize the SPIFI device (does not yet work).
	* configs/lpc4330-xplorer/include/board.h:  Reduce SPI SCLK value.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc43xx/lpc43_spifi.c, lpc43_spifi.h, and chip/lpc43_spifi.h:
	  Logic completely redesigned.  It now creates an MTD driver to access SPIFI...
	  but the driver still does not work.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32 and arch/arm/include/stm32: Make name of RTC ALARM interrupt
	  common on STM32 F1,2,4
	* arch/arm/src/stm32 and arch/arm/include/stm32: Add support for the
	  STM32F100x "Value Line" devices. This includes changes to stm32F10xx_rcc.c that
	  add the ability to run the chip off the internal oscillator.  There is no open
	  board configuration for this part yet (the STM32VLDiscovery would be a candidate).
	  Contributed by Mike Smith.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32: Fixed typos in conditional compilation in the CAN and DMA
	  and some pin configuration.  This would have caused problems for STM32 F107xx.
	  Typos noted by Mike Smith.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc43xx/lpc43_serial.c:  Add support for certain RS-485 features
	* lib/termios/lib_cfsetispeed.c, lib_cfsetospeed.c, lib_tcflush.c:  Add
	  simple implementations of cfsetispeed(), cfsetospeed(), and tcflush().
	* include/sys/str_tty.h, lib/lib_setspeed.c, lib_getspeed.c, and lib_resetspeed.c:
	  Add APIs to support setting non-standard BAUD values not supported by POSIX
	  termios.  These are non-standard interfaces but have a precedence:  There are
	  similar interfaces in AIX.
	* include/sys/str_tty.h, lib/lib_setspeed.c, lib_getspeed.c, and lib_resetspeed.c:
	  Sigh... removed.  We don't need any more almost standard interfaces!  (SVN
	  revision 4968 if you want the short-lived code).
	* include/termios.h and lib/termios/*:  Open the existing, standard termios
	  interfaces to permit some non-standard baud settings.  The new termios definitions
	  still supports the POSIX standard except that it does not strictly enforce
	  baud rate settings, permitting some non-portable, but useful baud rate settings
	  (this is what the short-lived AIX-like interfaces would have accomplished as well).
	* include/termios.h and lib/termios/*:  Redesigned yet again (this is getting
	  painful.  NuttX now supports the BOTHER baud setting just as Linux does.  termios
	  Bxxx definitions are again encoded; cf[set|get][o|i]speed now deal with only the
	  encoded values.  If the encoded baud is set to BOTHER, then the values in the (non-
	  standard) c_ispeed and c_ospeed baud values may be accessed directly.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_serial.c:  Add minimal termios support for the STM32
	  (BOTHER style baud settings only).  Contributed by Mike Smith.
	* configs/lpc4343-xplorer/src:  Clean up SPIFI-library based build to that it
	  actually works.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc43xx/lpc43_spifi.c:  Add support for verification to writes.
	  Add debug option to dump buffers.  Several bugfixes... almost works.
	* include/termios.h, lib/termios/*, and arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_serial.c: :
	  BOTHER is gone again.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_sdio.c and chip/stm32f20xx_pinmap.h:  STM32 F2 SDIO
	  fixes from Gary Teravskis and Scott Rondestvedt.
	* include/termios.h and lib/termios/*:  Replace cfsetispeed and cfsetospeed with
	  cfsetspeed (with definitions for the input/outputs in termios.h).
	* configs/stm32f4discovery/src and configs/stm32f4discovery/pm:  Add a power
	  management configuration for the STM32F4Discovery and supporting logic.  This
	  check-in also includes some fixes for the F4 RTC alarm logic.
	* drivers/input/pga11x.c and include/nuttx/input/pga11x.h:  Add support for the
	  TI PGA112/3/6/7 amplifier/multiplexer parts.
	* configs/mirtoo/README.txt, nsh/defconfig, and nxffs/defconfig:  Add support
	  for the PGA117 on the Mirtoo module.
	* drivers/analog/pga11x.c and include/nuttx/analog/pga11x.h:  These belong in
	  the analog subdirectories, not input.
	* configs/compal_e99/src/ssd1783.c and /ssd1783.h:  Drivers for the SSD1783
	  LCD found in the Motorola C155 telephone.  The driver is specific to the C155
	  because it uses the uwire transport.  Contributed by Denis Carilki and
	  Alan Carvalho de Assis.
	* drivers/power/pm_changestate.c.  Correct a case where interrupts were not
	  being re-enabled.  Found by Diego Sanchez.
	* configs/mirtoo/nxffs/defconfig:  This Mirtoo NXFFS configuration now uses the
	  open Pinguino toolchain by default.  This is necessary because the free C32
	  toolchain does not support any optimization and the unoptimized NXFFS image
	  hits the PIC32MX2 FLASH size (128K).  There is plenty of room to grow using
	  the Pinguino toolchain with -O2 optimization.
	* configs/mirtoo/src/up_adc.c.  This is just a stub for now, but this is
	  where Mirtoo ADC logic will eventually need to go.
	* arch/mips/src/pic32mx/pic32mx-gpio.c:  Now supports the PIC32MX1/2 ANSEL
	  IOPORT register.
	* lib/string/lib_memchr.c:  Add support for memchr() (contributed by Mike Smith)
	* lib/string/lib_memccpy.c:  Add support for memccpy()
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_serial.c:  Now supports ioctl commands to change
	  the baud using tcsetattr() (contributed by Chris Taglia).
	* arch/*/src/*_serial.c: Fix ioctl method return values.  These methods
	  should return a negated errno value; they should not set the errno
	  variable.
	* sched/on_exit.c, sched/task_exithook.c, and include/nuttx/sched.c:  Add
	  support for multiple registered on_exit() functions if CONFIG_SCHED_ONEXIT_MAX
	  is defined.
	* drivers/syslog/ramlog.c: Move the RAM SYSLOG device into drivers/syslog
	  so that it will be in the same directory as some new SYSLOGing devices
	  in the works.
	* include/nuttx/syslog.h and drivers/syslog/ramlog.c:  The SYSLOG putc function
	  now has a common name that is independent of the device that provides the
	  SYSLOG.
	* include/nuttx/syslog.h and drivers/syslog/syslog.c:  This is a new, generic
	  SYSLOG device that can redirect debug output to any character device or file.
	  So you can log debug output to a file or you can put the console on /dev/ttyS0
	  and the debug output on /dev/ttyS1.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc43xxl/lpc43_spifi.c: Correct an addressing error in the LPC43
	  SPIFI MTD driver
	* drivers/syslog/syslog.c and fs/fs_syslog.c:  Moved the generic syslog logic
	  from drivers/syslog to fs/ where is belongs.  Especially after realizing that
	  the syslog logic is going to have to some internal FS operations in order
	  to realize a totally thread-independent SYSLOG interface.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32*_rcc.c and .h:  If CONFIG_PM is defined, add a
	  function called stm32_clockenable() that can be used by PM logic to re-start
	  the PLL after re-awakening from deep sleep modes.
	* fs/fs_foreachinode.c and fs/fs_foreachmountpoint.c:  Add logic to traverse
	  inodes and mountpoints in the NuttX pseudo-file system.
	* fs/fat/fs_fat32.c: Max. filename length reported by statfs() was wrong
	  if FAT long file names were enabled.
	* lib/stdio/lib_libvsprintf.c:  Fieldwidth and justification were not
	  supported for the %s format.  As a result, %s, %12s, and %-12s all
	  produced the same output.
	* lib/stdio/lib_libdtoa.c:  Fix several issues with presenting floating
	  point numbers (conversions are fine, but presentation was bad).  This
	  is a critical bug fix if you use printf or sprintf to deal with floating
	  point numbers.
	* lib/stdio/lib_libdtoa.c and lib_libvsprintf.c:  Correct some floating
	  point options.
	* arch/arm/lpc43xx/lpc32_usb0dev.c:  Add framework for development of
	  an USB0, device-side driver for the LPC43XX.  The initial check-in,
	  however, is simply for the LPC31xx driver with name changes.  The
	  LPC31xx has the same USB IP, but will require some additional initialization
	  (and lots of testing) before it can be used with the LPC43xx.
	* nuttx/Documentation/NuttShell.html:  Added a section covering ways to
	  customize the behavior of NSH.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/chip/stm32f1*_pinmap.h: STM32 CAN TX/RX pins reversed;
	  inconsistent conditional compilation.  Reported by Max Holtzberg.
	* arch/arm/*/stm32:  Add support for STM32 F107 "Connectivity Line" 
	  Ethernet (contributed by Max Holtzberg).
	* configs/olimex-stm32-p107:  Add board support for the Olimiex STM32-P107
	   board (contributed by Max Holtzberg).
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32f2xx_dma.c, stm32f4xx_dma.c, stm32_serial.c, and
	  stm32_spic.c:  DMA priority was getting zeroed by STM32 F2/F4 DMA drivers
	  so that all DMAs ran at the lowest priority.
	* configs/stm3240g-eval/include/board.h and configs/stm3220:  Drop SD card
	  frequency from 24 to 16 MHz.  Apparently 24 MHz is too fast for the board.
	  This (plus the change to the STM32 DMA (above) fixes SDIO DMA on the
	  STM3240G-EVAL (and probably STM3220G-EVAL -- untested).
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32f2xx_dma.c and stm32f4xx_dma.c: Backed out the
	  DMA priority change just above.  The reduced SD card frequency was
	  necessary and sufficient to resolve the problem.
	* drivers/serial/serial.c:  open, read, write, and poll methods may now
	  abort return EINTR (or a short transfer size) if a signal is received
	  while waiting to receive or send serial data.  This behavior is required
	  by POSIX.
	* include/sys/types.h:  Define NULL to be (0) if __cplusplus is defined.
	  (contributed by Mike Smith)
	* include/ctype.h: Remove a stray semi-colon in a definitions (Thanks
	  Mike Smith).
	* configs/.../Make.defs.  Fix C++ include path set-up in Make.defs file
	  for all 8-bit AVR platforms (Thanks Richard Cochran).
	* lib/stdio/lib_*stream.c:  Revised to handle new error return values from
	  serial.c.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_spi.c:  SPI driver can now service re-
	  initialization (Mike Smith).
	* tools/mkconfig.c:  If CONFIG_DRAM_END is not specified, this tool
	  will provide default definition of (CONFIG_DRAM_START + CONFIG_DRAM_SIZE)
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_otgfshost.c:  Renamed from stm32_usbhost.c.
	  This is nearly code complete and, with any luck, will be available
	  in NuttX-6.21.
	* configs/*/defconfig:  Update all defconfig files to remove syntax
	  that is incompatible with the mconf configuration tool.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_otgfshost.c:  This driver now appears to be
	  functional (although more testing is necesary).

6.22 2012-09-29 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* include/semaphore.h, sched/sem_holders.c, and lib/semaphore/sem_init.c:
	  Fix some strange (and probably wrong) list handling when
	  CONFIG_PRIORITY_INHERITANCE and CONFIG_SEM_PREALLOCHOLDERS are defined.
	  This list handling was probably causing errors reported by Mike Smith
	* sched/sched_waitpid.c: Fix a possible issue with logic logic that
	  should be brought into a critical section (suggested by Mike Smith)
	* sched/sched_setuptaskfiles.c: Should be 'struct socket' not
	  'struct sockets'.  How did this compile before? (found by Kate)
	* syscall/syscall.csv:  Fix prototype for usleep() and prctl() (also
	  from Kate).
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_ethernet.c:  Conditionally elide setting PHY
	  speed/duplex.  This does not work for certain PHYs.  Still some unresolved
	  issues (also from Kate).
	* tools/Config.mk, Makefile, configs/*/Make.defs:  Add a new Makefile
	  fragment to de-quote certain strings from the Kconfig logic that
	  need to be used at path segments (Richard Cochran).
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_usbotghost.c:  The STM32 USB host driver only
	  works with debug turned on.  The problem appears to be that with debug
	  OFF, there are more NAKs occuring in more places than before and this
	  reveals a variety of errors.  This check in improves NAK robustness
	  for control transfers but does not resolve all of the issues.
	* configs/stm3220g-eval/*/defconfig:  Calibrated delay loop.  It had
	  never been calibrated was way off.
	* sched/sem_holder.c: Add logic to handler some priority inheritance
	  cases when sem_post() is called from an interrupt handler.  The
	  logic is clearly wrong, but it is not known if this is the
	  cause of any known bugs.
	* lib/stdio/lib_perror():  Add perror().  Contributed by Kate.
	* lib/string/lib_strerror():  Add option CONFIG_LIBC_STRERROR that
	  is now required to enabled strerror().  Add an option
	  CONFIG_LIBC_STRERROR_SHORT that can be used to output shortened
	  strings by strerror().
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_usbotghost.c:  Finally... the USB OTG FS
	  appears to handle NAKing correctly.
	* configs/stm32f4discovery/*:  Added and verifed support for USB OTG FS
	  host on the STM32F4Discovery board.
	* configs/*/defconfig: Remove configuration documentation from config
	  files.  It is redundant, error-prone, and difficult to maintain.
	  Configuration documentation is available in configs/README.txt for
	  common configurations and in configs/*/README.txt for board and MCU-
	  specific configurations.
	* configs/stm3240g-eval: Add USB host support.
	* sched/os_bring.c, configs/*/defconfig, tools/mkconfig.c, and others:  Added
	  configuration variable CONFIG_USER_ENTRYPOINT that may be used to change
	  the default entry from user_start to some other symbol.  Contributed by
	  Kate. NOTE: This change does introduce a minor backward incompatibility.
	  For example, if your application uses NSH as its start-up program, then your
	  build will now fail because it will be unable to find "user_start".  The fix
	  for this link failure is to add the following to your configuration file:
	  CONFIG_USER_ENTRYPOINT="nsh_main".
	* libs/stdio/lib_libfread.c and lib_*flush*.c:  Correct a couple of
	  error cases where the lib semaphore was not be released on error
	  exits (thanks Ronen Vainish).  Also, improved some error reporting:
	  the generic ERROR was being used instead of the specific errno
	  value; the errno variable was not always set correctly.
	* tools/mkfsdata.pl: The uIP web server CGI image making perl script was
	  moved from apps/netutils/webserver/makefsdata to nuttx/tools/mkfsdata.pl
	  (Part of a larger change submitted by Max Holtzberg).
	* configs/stm3240g-eval/script/ld.script:  All of the identical ld.script
	  files for the STM3240G-EVAL were replaced by one version in this directory.
	* configs/stm3240g-eval/webserver:  Configuration submitted by Max Holtzberg
	  for testing the changes to the uIP web server (see apps/ChangeLog.txt).
	* lib/stdio/lib_perror.c:  Remove CONFIG_LIBC_PERROR_DEVNAME.  What was I
	  thinking?  Arbitrary streams cannot be shared by different tasks.
	* tools/mksyscall.c, csvparser.c, and csvparser.h: Separate CSV parsing
	  logic from mksyscall.c into files where it can be shared.
	* tools/mksymtab.c:  Add a tool that can be used to convert a CSV file
	  into a NuttX-style symbol table.
	* sched/work_cancel.c:  Fix a bad assertion (reported by Mike Smith)
	* configs/stm3210e-eval/src/up_idle.c:  Correct some power management
	  compilation errors (reported by Diego Sanchez).
	* include/nuttx/wqueue.h, sched/work*, and others:  Added logic to support
	  a second, lower priority work queue (CONFIG_SCHED_LPWORK).
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_dma.c, chip/stm32*_memorymap.h:  FSMC SRAM is
	  only 16-bits wide and the SDIO DMA must be set up differently.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_dma.c:  Back out the 16-bit DMA change. It
	  is incorrect.
	* configs/:  Make use of UART4/5 vs USART4/5 consistent in all places.
	* Kconfig: Serial 2STOP setting must be integer 0/1, not a boolean.
	* lib/misc/sendfile.c and include/sys/sendfile.h:  Add a Linux style
	  sendfile() (non-standard!)
	* Kconfig: Refactor serial settings (moved from chip to drivers/serial).
	  AVR "teensy" now builds with Kconfig (contributed by Richard Cochran).
	* Kconfig: Add configuration settings for the LPC17xx
	* Kconfig: Add configuration settings for the LM3S (from Richard Cochran).
	* Kconfig: Verify configuration settings for the STM32.  This includes
	  changes in the way that the external SRAM is configured:  Define
	  CONFIG_HEAP2_SIZE (decimal) instead of CONFIG_HEAP2_END (hex).
	* tools/configure.sh:  Don't append the apps directory path setting
	  if the correct setting is already in defined in the defconfig file.
	* fs/fat/fs_utils.c:  Improperly constructed bool expression.  This
	  would cause many unnecessary writes to FLASH (Thanks Ronen Vainish).
	* Kconfig: Verify configuration settings for the LPC43xx.  This includes
	  some corrections to configuration variable names and defconfig settings.
	* Kconfig: Add and verify configuration settings for the LPC31xx.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_uart.h and stm32_serial.c:  Add logic to
	  re-initialize the console UART as needed to enable DMA on the
	  console UART (contributed by Mike Smith).
	* net/recvfrom.c, net/Kconfig, include/nuttx/net/uipopt.h: Remove delay
	  after receiving data.  That has historical reasons to be there (it
	  was needed before read-ahead buffering was added), but kills performance.
	  (Noted by Max Holtzberg).
	* configs/shenzhou:  Add beginnings of a board configuration for the
	  Shenzhou STM32107 board (see www.armjishu.com).  Very little is in
	  place as of this initial check-in.
	* QEMU: Fixes from Richard Cochran to build QEMU with Kconfig files.
	* arch/*/src/Makefile:  Remove some old logic that was kicked off
	  when CONFIG_BOOT_RUNFROMFLASH=y.  The old logic used to use
	  objcopy to move sections.  Newer logic changes the load position
	  of sections in the the linker script.  As far as I can tell, there
	  is nothing in the source tree now that depends on the old way of
	  doing things (if I am wrong, they will need a change to the linker
	  script).
	* configs/fire-stm32v2:  Configuration for the M3 Wildfire board.  I
	  don't know very much about this board other than is has an
	  STM32F103VET6 chip, LCD, touchscreen, and ENC28J60 network.  Very
	  little is in place on the initial check-in.
	* configs/shenzhou: Coding for the Shenzhou board port is complete,
	  but tested has been deferred until I get the right tools.
	* arch/arc/include/stm32/chip.h and arch/arm/src/stm32/chip.h:
	  Add support for the STM32F103VET6.
	* fs/fs_fdopen.c: Bad check for failure to allocate memory.  (Noted
	  by Ronen Vainish).
	* drivers/mmcsd/mmcsd_sdio.c: If the MMC/SD driver were ever
	  uninitialized then there would be a double release of memory
	  (Noted by Ronen Vainish).
	* fs/mmap/fs_rammap.c:  Fix logic error and errno check (contributed
	  by Kate).
	* arch/avr/src: Fixes from AVR32 build errors that have crept in
	  over the time; incorporated Kconfig for AVR3 (Richard Cochran).
	* fs/fat and include/nuttx/fs/fat.h: The FAT file system allocates
	  memory for sector I/O buffers used to exchange data with the
	  configured block driver.  In some contexts, the block driver may
	  require DMA-capable memory.  If CONFIG_FAT_DMAMEMORY is defined,
	  then the FAT FS will use platform-provided DMA memory allocators
	  to allocate the block driver I/O buffers.
	* CONFIG_NET_ENC28J60 renamed CONFIG_ENC28J60 to be consistent
	  in all places.
	* drivers/enc28j60.c, include/nuttx/net/enc28j60.h, and 
	  olimex-strp711/src/up_enc28j60.c:  No longer passes IRQ number
	  as a parameter.  Instead now passes a call table to manage
	  ENC28J60 GPIO interrupts.  That is because GPIO interrupts are
	  handled in different ways by different MCUs and some do not
	  support IRQ numbers for GPIO interrupts.
	* mm/mm_gran* and include/nuttx/gran.h:  Add a simple granule-
	  based allocator.  The intent of this allocator is to support
	  simple allocation of DMA I/O buffers.  The initial check-in
	  is code complete but untested (not event built into the
	  mm/Makefile yet.
	* confgs/fire-stm32v2: The board port is basically functional.
	  Not all features have been verified.  The ENC28J60 network
	  is not yet functional.
	* configs/stm3240g-eval/discover:  A configuration for testing
	  the UDP discovery utility.  Contributed by Max Holtzberg.
	* mm/README.txt:  Add a new README file.
	* include/nuttx/usb/usb.h, arch/*/src/*usb.c, and arch/*/src/*otg*.c:
	  Add hooks to to use common, external DMA buffer allocation
	  implementation.
	* net/recvfrom.c: Don't block in recvfrom if (1) read-ahead buffering
	  is enabled and (2) some data was obtained from read-ahead buffers.
	  Blocking is a bad idea in that case because there is no timeout!
	  (submitted by Max Holtzberg).
	* configs/stm3240g-eval/xmlrpc: An example configuration for the
	  Embeddable Lightweight XML-RPC Server at apps/examples/xmlrpc.
	  See http://www.drdobbs.com/web-development/\
	  an-embeddable-lightweight-xml-rpc-server/184405364 for more info.
	  Contributed by Max Holtzberg.
	* configs/*/nxwm/defconfig and sched/task_exithook.c: Fixes for
	  bugs that crept in during recent changes.  (Submitted by Max
	  Holtzberg).
	* arch/arm/include/armv7-m/irq.h:  Fix a critical bug in irqsave().
	  It looks like sometimes the compile will re-order some instructions
	  inapproapriately.  This end result is that interrupts will get
	  stuck off.
	* drivers/mtd/w25.c:  Beginning of a driver for the Windbond SPI
	  FLASH family (W25x16, W25x32, and W25x64).  The initial check-in
	  is basically just the SST25 driver with some name changes.
	* arch/arm/include/armv7-m/irq.h and arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_spi.c:
	  Back out the last change in irq.h.  It is (most likely) fine the
	  way it was.  The really interrupt related problem was in stm32_spi.c:
	  When SPI3 is not enabled, then the irqrestore() falls in the
	  else clause.
	* include/nuttx/compiler.h and other files:  Moved always_inline
	  and noinline __attributes__ here.  Also replaced all occurrences
	  of explicit __atributes__ in other files with definitions from
	  this header file.
	* drivers/mtd/w25.c:  The Windbond SPI FLASH W25 FLASH driver is
	  code complete (but still untested).
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_i2c.c:  I2C improvements from Mike Smith.
	  Unified configuration logic; dynamic timeout calculations;
	  I2C reset logic to recover from locked devices on the bus.
	* configs/*/*/Make.defs, tools/Config.mk, Makefile:  Refactor all
	  common make definitions from the various Make.defs files into
	  the common tools/Config.mk.  Add support for a verbosity options:
	  Specify V=1 on the make command line in order to see the exact
	  commands used in the build (Contributed by Richard Cochran).
	* drivers/net/enc28j60.c:  The ENC28J60 Ethernet driver is
	  now functional.
	* configs/fire-stm32v2:  Add support or the fire-stm32v3 board as
	  well (untested because I do not have a v3 board).
	* lib/stdio/lib_sscanf.c:  Add %n psuedo-format (from Kate).
	* lib/stdio/lib_sscanf.c:  There is an issue of handling input
	  when (1) no fieldwidth is provided and (2) there is no space
	  seperating the input values.  No solutions is in place for this
	  case now (either space or a fieldwidth must be provided).  But
	  at least some of the bad logic that attempted to handle this
	  case has been removed (noted by Kate).
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_eth.c:  DMA buffer sizes must be an
	  even multiple of 4, 8, or 16 bytes.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_idle.c:  Fixes STM32F107 DMA issues:
	  We cannot go into sleep mode while Ethernet is actively DMAing.
	* configs/shenzhou/src/up_ssd1289.c:  Add infrastructure to support
	  SSD1289 LCD.  Initial checkin is just a clone of the
	  STM32F4Discovery's FSMC-based LCD interface.  The Shenzhou
	  will need a completely need bit-banging interface; this
	  initial check-in is only for the framework.
	* configs/shenzhou/src/up_ssd1289.c:  Bit-banging driver is
	  code complete.
	* configs/shenzhou/src/up_lcd.c:  Oops. Shenzhou LCD does not
	  have an SSD1289 controller.  Its an ILI93xx.  Ported the
	  STM3240G-EVAL ILI93xx driver to work on the Shenzhou board.
	* configs/shenzhou/nxwm:  Added an NxWM configuration for the
	  Shenzhou board.  This is untested on initial check-in.  It will
	  be used to verify the Shenzhou LCD driver (and eventually the
	  touchscreen driver).
	* configs/shenzhou/src/up_touchscreen.c:  Add ADS7843E touchscreen
	  support for the Shenzhou board.  The initial check-in is untested
	  and basically a clone of the the touchscreen support for the SAM-3U.
	* tools/cfgparser.c: There are some NxWidget configuration
	  settings that must be de-quoted.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/Kconfig: There is no SPI4.  Some platforms
	  support SPI3 and some do not (still not clear).
	* nuttx/configs/shenzhou: Various fixes to build new NxWM
	  configuration.
	* configs/shenzhou:  Oops.  The Shenzhou LCD is and SSD1289,
	  not an ILI93xx.
	* configs/shenzhou/src/up_ssd1289.c: The LCD is basically functional
	  on the Shenzhou board.
	* graphics/nxmu:  Correct some bad parameter checking that caused
	  failures when DEBUG was enabled.
	* arch/arm/src/armv7-m/nvic.h:  Add bit definitions for the AIRCR
	  register.
	* drivers/input/ads7843.c:  Need semaphore protection in logic
	  that samples the position.
	* drivers/lcd/ssd1289.c:  On some platforms we are unable to
	  read the device ID -- reason unknown; workaround in place.
	* drivers/input/ads7843.c:  Add thresholding options and an
	  option to swap X and Y positions.  Fix some logic errors in
	  the SPI locking/selecting logic.
	* arch/arm/src/armv7-m/up_systemreset.c:  Add logic to reset
	  the Cortex-Mx using the AIRCR register.  Contributed by Darcy
	  Gong.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/up_eth.c:  Add logic specifically for the
	  DM9161 PHY.  If the DM9161 failed to initialize, then use the
	  up_sysemreset() logic to reset the MCU.  Contributed by Darcy
	  Gong.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_gpio.c:  Add missing logic to set bit
	  for SPI3 remap.  This fixes the XPT2046 touchscreen driver using
	  drivers/input/ads7843.c
	* configs/shenzhou/src/up_ssd1289.c:  Fix naming error in
	  conditional compilation.
	* configs/shenzhou/nxwm/defconfig:  Disable reading from the LCD.
	  This does not work.  The hardware and the driver support the
	  capability, but there is some bug that causes memory corruption.
	  The work around for now:  Just disable reading from the LCD.
	* drivers/lcd/ssd1289.c:  Add some logic to reduce the amount of
	  output when CONFIG_DEBUG_LCD is enabled.
	* configs/shenzhou/nxwm/defconfig:  Bug found and fixed... The
	  original configuration had too much stuff turned on.  Reducing
	  stack sizes, some features, and buffer sizes made the
	  configuration reliable (Reading from the LCD is still disabled).
	* net/uip/uip_icmpping.c:  Fix problem that prevented ping from
	  going outside of local network.  Submitted by Darcy Gong

6.23 2012-11-05 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_rng.c, chip/stm32_rng.h, and other files:
	  Implementation of /dev/random using the STM32 Random Number
	  Generator (RNG).
	* board.h file for shenzhou, fire-stm32v2, and olimex-stm32-p107:
	  Add frequencies for HSE, HSI, LSE, and LSI.  These are needed
	  by the STM32 watchdog driver.
	* CONFIG_EXAMPLES_*: To make things consistent, changed all occurrences
	  of CONFIG_EXAMPLE_* to CONFIG_EXAMPLES_*.
	* drivers/mtd/w25.c and configs/*/src/up_w25.c:  Several fixes for the
	  W25 SPI FLASH.
	* configs/*/Make.defs:  All buildroot tools now use the extension
	  xxx-nuttx-elf- vs. xxx-elf-
	* configs/shenzhou/*/Make.defs:  Now uses the new buildroot 4.6.3
	  EABI toolchain.
	* lib/stdio/lib_libdtoa.c:  Another dtoa() fix from Mike Smith.
	* configs/shenzhou/src/up_adc.c:  Add ADC support for the Shenzhou
	  board (Darcy Gong).
	* configs/shenzhou/thttpd:  Add a THTTPD configuration for the
	  Shenzhou board (Darcy Gong).
	* include/termios.h and lib/termios/libcf*speed.c: The non-standard,
	  "hidden" c_speed cannot be type const or else static instantiations
	  of termios will be required to initialize it (Mike Smith).
	* drivers/input/max11802.c/h, and include/nuttx/input max11802.h:  Adds
	  support for the Maxim MAX11802 touchscreen controller (contributed by
	  Petteri Aimonen).
	* graphics/nxtk/nxtk_events.c:  Missing implementation of the blocked
	  method.  This is a critical bugfix for graphics support (contributed
	  by Petteri Aimonen).
	* drivers/usbdev/pl2303.c, drivers/usbdev/usbmsc.h, and
	  include/nuttx/usb/cdcacm.h: USB_CONFIG_ATTR_SELFPOWER vs.
	  USB_CONFIG_ATT_SELFPOWER (contributed by Petteri Aimonen).
	* arch/arm/src/armv7-m/up_memcpy.S:  An optimized memcpy() function for
	  the ARMv7-M family contributed by Mike Smith.
	* lib/strings/lib_vikmemcpy.c:  As an option, the larger but faster
	  implemementation of memcpy from Daniel Vik is now available (this is
	  from http://www.danielvik.com/2010/02/fast-memcpy-in-c.html).
	* lib/strings/lib_memset.c: CONFIG_MEMSET_OPTSPEED will select a
	  version of memset() optimized for speed.  By default, memset() is
	  optimized for size.
	* lib/strings/lib_memset.c: CONFIG_MEMSET_64BIT will perform 64-bit
	  aligned memset() operations.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_adc.c:  Need to put the ADC back into the
	  initial reset in the open/setup logic.  Opening the ADC driver works
	  the first time, but not the second because the device is left in a
	  powered down state on the last close.
	* configs/olimex-lpc1766stck/scripts:  Replace all of the identical
	  ld.script files with the common one in this directory.
	* configs/stm3220g-eval/scripts:  Replace all of the identical
	  ld.script files with the common one in this directory.
	* configs/hymini-stm32v/scripts:  Replace all of the identical
	  ld.script files with the common one in this directory.
	* configs/lpcxpresso-lpc1768/scripts:  Replace all of the identical
	  ld.script files with the common one in this directory.
	* binfmt/elf.c, binfmt/libelf, include/elf.h, include/nuttx/elf.h: Add
	  basic framework for loadable ELF module support.  The initial check-
	  in is non-functional and is simply the framework for ELF support.
	* include/nuttx/binfmt.h, nxflat.h, elf.h, and symtab.h:  Moved to
	  include/nuttx/binfmt/.
	* arch/sim/src/up_elf.c and arch/x86/src/common/up_elf.c:  Add
	  for ELF modules.
	* arch/arm/include/elf.h:  Added ARM ELF header file.
	* include/elf32.h:  Renamed elf.h to elf32.h.
	* configs/stm32f4discovery/ostest:  Converted to use the new
	  Kconfig-based configuration system.
	* configs/stm32f4discovery/elf and configs/stm32f4discovery/scripts/gnu-elf.ld
	  Add a configuration for testing the ARM ELF loader.
	* binfmt/libelf:  Can't use fstat(). NuttX does not yet support it.  Damn!
	* binfmt/libelf:  The basic ELF module execution appears fully functional.
	* configs/shenzhou/src/up_relays.c:  Add support for relays from the
	  Shenzhou board.  Contributed by Darcy Gong.
	* lib/fixedmath: Moved the old lib/math to lib/fixedmath to make room for
	  the math library from the Rhombus OS
	* lib/math: Now contains the math library from the Rhombus OS by Nick Johnson
	  (submitted by Darcy Gong).
	* include/float.h:  Add a first cut at the float.h header file.  This
	  really should be an architecture/toolchain-specific header file.  It
	  is only used if CONFIG_ARCH_FLOAT_H is defined.
	* lib/math: Files now conform to coding standards.  Separated float,
	  double, and long double versions of code into separate files so that
	  they don't draw in so much un-necessary code when doing a dumb link.
	* binfmt/libelf:  The ELF loader is working correctly with C++ static
	  constructors and destructors and all.
	* Documentation/NuttXBinfmt.html:  Add documentation of the binary loader.
	* configs/sim/ostest:  Converted to use the mconf configuration tool.
	* configs/sim/cxxtest:  New test that will be used to verify the uClibc++
	  port (eventually).
	* include/nuttx/fs/fs.h, lib/stdio/lib_libfread.c, lib_ferror.c,
	  lib_feof.c, and lib_clearerr.c:  Add support for ferror(), feof(),
	  and clearerror().  ferror() support is bogus at the moment (it
	  is equivalent to !feof()); the others should be good.
	* configs/stm32f4discovery/include/board.h:  Correct timer 2-7
	  base frequency (provided by Freddie Chopin).
	* include/nuttx/sched.h, sched/atexit.c, and sched/task_deletehook.c:
	  If both atexit() and on_exit() are enabled, then implement atexit()
	  as just a special caseof on_exit().  This assumes that the ABI can
	  handle receipt of more call parameters than the receiving function
	  expects.  That is usually the case if parameters are passed in
	  registers.
	* libxx/libxx_cxa_atexit():  Implements __cxa_atexit()
	* configs/stm32f4discovery/cxxtest:  New test that will be used to
	  verify the uClibc++ port (eventually).  The sim platform turned not
	  to be a good platform for testing uClibc++.  The sim example will not
	  run because the simulator will attempt to execute the static
	  constructors before main() starts. BUT... NuttX is not initialized
	  and this results in a crash.  On the STM324Discovery, I will have
	  better control over when the static constructors run.
	* RGMP 4.0 updated from Qiany Yu.
	* configs/*/Make.defs and configs/*/ld.script:  Massive clean-up
	  and standardization of linker scripts from Freddie Chopin.
	* net/netdev_ioctl.c:  Add interface state flags and ioctl calls
	  to bring network interfaces up and down (from Darcy Gong).
	* config/stm32f4discovery: Enable C++ exceptions.  Now the entire
	  apps/examples/cxxtest works -- meaning the the uClibc++ is
	  complete and verified for the STM32 platform.

6.24 2012-12-20 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* arch/arm/src/stm32:  Support for STM32F100 high density chips
	  added by Freddie Chopin.
	* configs/stm32f100_generic:  Support for generic STM32F100RC board
	  contributed by Freddie Chopin.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32_otgfsdev.c:  Partial fix from Petteri Aimonen.
	* drivers/lcd/ug-2864ambag01.c and include/nuttx/lcd/ug_2864ambag01.h:
	  LCD driver for the Univision OLED of the same name (untested on
	  initial check-in).
	* configs/stm32f4discovery/nxlines:  Configure to use mconf/Kconfig
	  tool.
	* configs/stm32f4discovery/src/up_ug2864ambag01.c:  Board-specific
	  initialization for UG-2864AMBAG01 OLED connecte to STM32F4Disovery.
	* libxx/libxx_stdthrow.cxx:  Exception stubs from Petteri Aimonen.
	* configs/stm32f4discovery/src/up_ug2864ambag01.c: Driver has been
	  verified on the STM32F4Discovery platform.  Some tuning of the
	  configuration could improve the presentation.  Lower resolution displays
	  are also more subject to the "fat, flat line bug" that I need to fix
	  someday.  See http://www.nuttx.org/doku.php?id=wiki:graphics:nxgraphics
	  for a description of the fat, flat line bug.
	* libc:  Renamed nuttx/lib to nuttx/libc to make space for a true lib/
	  directory that will be forthcoming.  Also rename libraries:  liblib.a -> libc.a,
	  libulib.a -> libuc.a, libklib.a -> libkc.a, liblibxx.a ->libcxx.a.
	  (I will probably, eventually rename libxx to libcxx for consistency)
	* Makefile, lib/: A new, empty directory that will hold generated libraries.
	  This simplifies the library patch calculations and lets me get rid of some
	  bash logic.  The change is functional, but only partially complete;
	  additional logic is needed in the arch/*/src/Makefile's as well.  Right
	  now that logic generate multiple library paths, all pointing to the lib/
	  directory.
	* arch/*/src/Makefile:  Now uses only the libraries in lib/
	  Replace bash fragments that test for board/Makefile.
	* Makefile.win:  The beginnings of a Windows-native build.  This is just
	  the beginning and not yet ready for prime time use.
	* configs/stm32f4discovery/winbuild:  This is a version of the standard
	  NuttX OS test, but configured to build natively on Windows.  Its only
	  real purpose is to very the native Windows build logic.
	* tools/mkdeps.bat and tools/mkdeps.c:  mkdeps.bat is a failed attempt
	  to leverage mkdeps.sh to CMD.exe.  It fails because the are certain
	  critical CFLAG values that cannot be passed on the CMD.exe command line
	  (like '=').  mkdeps.c is a work in progress that will, hopefully,
	  replace both mkdeps.sh and mkdeps.bat.
	* tools/Config.mk:  Centralize the definition of the script that will be
	  used to generated header file include paths for the compiler.  This
	  needs to be centralized in order to support the Windows native build.
	* tools/incdir.bat:  A replacement for tools/incdir.sh for use with the
	  the Windows native build.
	* Makefile.unix:  The existing top-level Makefile has been renamed
	  Makefile.unix.
	* Makefile:  This is a new top-level Makefile that just includes
	  either Makefile.unix or Makefile.win
	* configs/stm3240g-eval/src:  Qencoder fixes from Ryan Sundberg.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_qencoder.c: TIM3 bug fix from Ryan Sundberg.
	* tools/mkromfsimg.sh: Correct typo in an error message (Ryan Sundberg)
	* arch/*/src/Makefile:  Remove tftboot install and creation of System.map
	  for Windows native build.  The first is a necessary change, the second
	  just needs re-implemented.
	* configs/mirtoo: Update Mirtoo pin definitions for Release 2.  Provided
	  by Konstantin Dimitrov.
	* Fixed an uninitialized variable in the file system that can cause 
	  assertions if DEBUG on (contributed by Lorenz Meier).
	* Config.mk:  Defined DELIM to be either / or \, depending upon
	  CONFIG_WINDOWS_NATIVE.  This will allow me to eliminate a lot of
	  conditional logic elsewhere.
	* nuttx/graphics: One a mouse button is pressed, continue to report all
	  mouse button events to the first window that received the the initial
	  button down event, even if the mouse attempts to drag outside the
	  window. From Petteri Aimonen.
	* nuttx/graphics/nxmu/nx_block.c:  One more fix to the NX block message
	  logic from Petteri Aimonen.
	* include/nuttx/wqueue.h: Some basic definitions to support a user-
	  space work queue (someday in the future).
	* graphics/nxmu:  Add semaphores so buffers messages that send buffers
	  will block until the buffer data has been acted upon.
	* graphics/nxmw:  Extended the blocked messages to cover mouse movement
	  and redraw events.  These will also cause problems if sent to a window
	  while it is closing.
	* arch/several:  Change UARTs are enabled for i.MX, LM3S, ez80, and M16C to
	  match how they are enabled for other architectures.
	* configs/ez80f910200kitg:  Convert to use mconf configuration.
	* sched/pause.c:  Implements the POSIX pause() function.
	* ez80: Lots of changes to ez80 configurations and build logic as I
	  struggle to get a clean Windows build (still not working).
	* configs/cloudctrl:   Darcy Gong's CloudController board.  This is a
	  small network relay development board. Based on the Shenzhou IV development
	  board design.  It is based on the STM32F107VC MCU.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32_serial.c and stm32_lowputc.c:  Added optional RS-485
	  direction bit control. From Freddie Chopin.
	* Lots of build files:  ARMv7-M and MIPS32 Make.defs now include a common
	  Toolchain.defs file that can be used to manage toolchains in a more
	  configurable way.  Contributed by Mike Smith
	* configs/stm32f4discovery/winbuild and configs/cloudctrl:  Adapted to use
	  Mike's Toolchain.defs.
	* tools/configure.sh:  Adapted to handle paths and setenv.bat files correctly
	  for native Windows builds.
	* More of build files:  AVR and AVR32 Make.defs now include a common
	  Toolchain.defs file that can be used to manage toolchains in a more
	  configurable way.  Contributed by Mike Smith
	* tools/incdir.sh and incdir.bat: Add -s option to generate system header
	  file paths.
	* nuttx/arch/arm/src/arm/Toolchain.defs: Add support for more ARM toolchains
	  (from Mike Smith).
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32f40xxx_rcc.c:  Enabled FLASH prefetch (from Petteri
	  Aimonen).
	* graphics/nxtk/nxtk_filltrapwindow.c:  Correct an offset problem (from
	  Peterri Aimonen).
	* graphics/nxglib/nxglib_splitline.c:  Fix error in drawing of near horizontal
	  lines (from Peterri Aimonen).
	* sched/task_exithook.c:  Missing right bracket with certain conditional
	  compilation (thanks James Goppert).
	* arch/arm/srch/stm32/stm32_otgfshost.c:  Replace timeout handling; use
	  system tick instead of frame counter.  The frame counter gets reset to
	  zero at 0x3fff making it error prone.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32f20xx_rcc.c and stm32f40xx_rcc.c: Added option
	  CONFIG_STM32_FLASH_PREFETCH.  FLASH prefetch will now only be enabled
	  if this option is selected.
	* confgs/ez80f910200zco/ostest:  Now uses Kconfig/mconf configuration
	  tool. Updated to build in native Windows environment.  Other ez80f910200zco
	  build scripts also updated.
	* configs/z8f64200100kit/ostest: Update to same level as ez80 configurations.
	* nuttx/configs/z8f64200100kit/scripts/setenv.bat: Add support for native
	  Windows build.
	* nuttx/arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_i2c.c: Resources not being released when
	  I2C is uninitialized.
	* cloudctrl/src/up_chipid.c and shenzhou/src/up_chipid.c:  Add functions to
	  get chip ID.  Contributed by Darcy Gong.  These should not be board-dependent,
	  but should be in arch/arm/src/stm32 where they can be used from any board.
	* sched/work_thread.c: Fix backward conditional compilation.  This might
	  has caused a memory leak.  From Freddie Chopin.
	* configs/<many>/Make.defs:  Fix typo -wstrict-prototypes should be
	  -Wstrict-prototypes (From Denis Carilki).
	* arch/arm/src/calapyso/calypso_keypad.c:  Add Calypso keypad driver.  From
	  Denis Carilki.
	* z8encore000zco/ostest and z8f64200100kit/ostest:  Converted to use Kconfig/
	  mconf configuration tool.
	* arch/arm/src/armv7-m/up_exception.S: missing curly braces for push/pop
	  From Freddie Chopin.
	* z8encore000zco/ostest and z8f64200100kit/ostest:  Can now be modified to
	  support the Windows native builds (see corresponding README.txt files).
	* configs/z16f2800100zcog - All configurations updated to use the ZDS-II
	  5.0.1 toolchain.
	* configs/z16f2800100zcog - All configurations updated to use Kconfig/mconf
	  configuration tools.
	* configs/z16f2800100zcog/ostest - Now supports a native Windows build
	  (other ZNEO configs may also support the native build, but this has not
	  been verfiied).
	* include/nuttx/input/keypad.h, arch/arm/src/calypso/calypso_keypad.c, and
	  configs/compal_e99/nsh_highram: First cut at a standard keypad interface
	  definition.  Contributed by Denis Carikli.
	* libc/stdlib/lib_rand.c:  Always add one to result congruential generators
	  to avoid the value zero.  Suggested by Freddie Chopin.
	* tools/b16.c:  Fixed precision math conversion utility.
	* graphics/nxglib/nxglib_splitline.c:  Fix the "fat, flat line bug"
	* arch/z80/src/*/Toolchain.defs:  Add dummy Toolchain.defs files for the
	  z80 family.
	* configs/z80sim/ostest:  Converted to build with the Kconfig/mconf tool.
	  Current configuration failed to build for me (Ubuntu 12.10, SDCC 3.2.0
	  pre-built for Linux) due to a glibc memory corruptionerror in SDCC.
	* configs/z80sim/ostest: Default is now the Windows native build.  See
	  configs/z80sim/README.txt for instructions to convert back to a Linux or
	  or Cygwin build.
	* arch/z80/src/Makefile.sdccw:  Renamed makefiles with extensions zdiil,
	  zdiiw, sdccl, and sdccw for the ZDS-II vs SDCC compilers and for the
	  POSIX vs Windows native builds.
	* nuttx/drivers/mtd/ftl.c:  Fix for the flash translation layer. Short
	  unaligned writes were buggy.  From Petteri Aimonen.
	* nuttx/libc/math/lib_round*.c:  Add rounding functions to the math
	  library.  Contributed by Petteri Aimonen.
	* include/cxx/cstdlib:  Add stroul().  From Petteri Aimonen.
	* arch/*/include/limits.h:  Change signed minimum values from, for example,
	  (-128) to (-127 - 1) to avoid overflows under certain conditions.  From
	  Peterri Aimonen.
	* graphics/nxtk/nxtk_subwindowmove.c: Previously it was very difficult to
	  do e.g. "scroll by dx, dy". When given the full window area, nxtk_subwindowmove
	  would clip the offset always to 0,0. It makes more sense for it to clip the
	  source area and not modify the offset.  From Petteri Aimonen.
	* graphics/nxtk/nxtk_getwindow.c: Clipping would change the offset of returned
	  data, and caller has no way to know what the new offset would be. This messes
	  up font drawing when the text is partially out of window, e.g. when scrolling.
	  Also from Petteri Aimonen.
	* include/stdbool.h: Can now be disabled for C++ files if CONFIG_C99_BOOL8 is
	  defined.  CONFIG_C99_BOOL8 indicates (1) that the sizeof(_Bool) is one in both
	  C and C++, and (2) the the C compiler is C99 and supports the _Bool intrinsic
	  type. Requested by Freddie Chopin.
	* include/stdlib/lib_rand.c:  Various additional changes so that the integer
	  value zero can be returned.  Requested by Freddie Chopin.
	* arch/z80/src/Makefile.sdcc*, z80/up_mem.h:  Redesign Z80 build so that it
	  no longer depends on Bash scripts.
	* configs/z80sim/nsh and pashello:  Converted to (1) use the kconfig-frontends
	  configuration tool, and (2) to build natively under Windows.  The NSH
	  configuration is verified; the pashello configuration needs a more TLC.
	* tools/copydir.sh:  Rename tools/winlink.sh to tools/copydir.sh
	* tools/link.bat, unlink.bat, and copydir.bat:  Add Windows counterparts
	  to the link.sh, unlink.sh, and copydir.sh Bash scripts.
	* configs/z80sim/pashello:  Now builds correctly.
	* configs/xtrs/ostest, nsh, and pashello:  Converted to (1) use the kconfig-
	  frontends configuration tool, and (2) to build natively under Windows.
	* drivers/serial/Kconfig and sched/Kconfig:  Two names for same configuration:
	  CONFIG_LOWLEVEL_CONSOLE is bogus and CONFIG_DEV_LOWCONSOLE is in the wrong
	  Kconfig file.  Moved to drivers/serial/Kconfig replacing CONFIG_LOWLEVEL_CONSOLE.
	* arch/z80/include/z180:  Add header files for z180 chips.  Initial versions
	  are just clones of z80 header files.
	* arch/z80/src/z180:  Add source files for z180 chips.  Initial versions
	  are just clones of z80 source files.
	* include/nuttx/arch.h:  Add address environment control interfaces (for use
	  with CPUs the provide MCUs and support process-like address environments).
	* arch/z80/src/z180/z180_mmu.*:  Add MMU support for z180 tasks.
	* configs/p112:  Add very basic board support and an examples/ostest
	  configuration for the venerable P112 board.
	* sched/os_bringup.c: If CONFIG_PATH_INITIAL is defined, then the initial
	  environment of the task started by os_bringup() will have the PATH
	  environment variable defined to be that string.
	* binfmt/binfmt_exepath.c:  If CONFIG_BINFMT_EXEPATH is defined, then this
	  file will be built.  It contains logic to search for regular files at
	  the absolutes paths found in the current PATH environment variable
	  setting.  This is untested and not yet hooked into the binfmt exec()
	  logic on initial check-in
	* binfmt/binfmt_loadmodule.c: load_module() will now traverse the PATH
	  variable to locate files from their relative path.
	* include/nuttx/arch.h and arch/z80/src/z180/z180_mmu.c:  Restructure the
	  address environment interfaces so that they will better integrate with
	  binfmt/.
	* binfmt/libelf/*, binfmt/libnxflat/* and other files:  Integrate the
	  address environment interfaces.  If CONFIG_ADDRENV=y, then binfmt/
	  will now create an address environment for new tasks (instead of
	  just malloc'ing the task memory).
	* configs/stm32f4discovery/elf:  Enable support/test of the PATH
	  to find executables using a relative path.

6.25 2013-xx-xx Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* graphics/: Adds 5x8 monospace font. This tiny font is useful for graph
	  labels and for small bitmapped display.  Contributed by Petteri
	  Aimonen.
	* configs/stm3220g-eval/nxwm:  Converted to use the kconfig-frontends
	  configuration tool.
	* configs/sim/nxwm:  Converted to use the kconfig-frontends configuration
	  tool.
	* include/pthread.h:  In sys/prctl.h because it is needed by
	  pthread_[set|get]name_np()
	* tools/kconfig.bat:  Kludge to run kconfig-frontends from a DOS shell.
	* sched/sig_timedwait.c:  Should always move the time up to the next
	  largest number of system ticks.  The logic was rounding.  Noted by
	  Petteri Aimonen.
	* arch/arm/src/up_head.S:  Fix backward conditional compilation.  NOTE
	  there is a issue of ARM9 systems with low vectors and large memories
	  that will have to be addressed in the future.
	* libc/misc/lib_kbdencode.c and lib_kbddecode.c:  Add logic to marshal
	  and serialized "out-of-band" keyboard commands intermixed with normal
	  ASCII data (not yet hooked into anything).
	* drivers/usbhost/usbhost_hidkbd.c:  If CONFIG_HIDKBD_ENCODED is
	  defined, this driver will now use libc/misc/lib_kbdencode.c to
	  encode special function keys.
	* configs/olimex-lpc1766stk/hidkbd:  This configuration has been
	  converted to use the kconfig-frontends configuration tool.
	* drivers/lcd/ug-2864hsweg01.c and include/nuttx/lcd/ug-2864hsweg01.h:
	  Driver for UG-2864HSWEG01 OLED contributed by Darcy Gong.
	* configs/stm32f4discovery/src/up_ug2864hsweg01.c: Support for the
	  UG-2864HSWEG01 OLED for the STM32F4Discovery board.
	* drivers/usbhost/usbhost_hidkbd.c:  Correct a logic error in how
	  tasks waiting for read data are awakened.
	* libc/misc/lib_kbdencode.c and lib_kbddecode.c:  Now handles keypress
	  events too.  However, the USB HID keyboard drier has not yet been
	  updated to detect key release events.  That is kind of tricky in
	  the USB HID keyboard report data.
	* configs/mcu123-214x/nsh:  Converted to use the kconfig-frontends
	  configuration tool.
	* configs/zp214xpa:  Add basic support for the The0.net ZP213x/4xPA
	  board (with the LPC2148 and the UG_2864AMBAG01).
	* configs/sim/nxlines:  Add an nxlines configuration for the
	  simulator.
	* configs/zp214xpa/nxlines:  Add an nxlines configuration for the
	  ZP213x/4xPA (with the LPC2148 and the UG_2864AMBAG01).  Working
	  as of 2012-12-30.
	* configs/olimex-lpc1766stk/wlan:  Remove non-functional
	  configuration.
	* configs/stm32f4discovery/src and nuttx/drivers/lcd/ug-2864hsweg01.c:
	  Updates and correctinos for the UG-2864HSWEG01 from Darcy Gong.
	* configs/lm326965-ek:  All configurations converted to use the
	  kconfig-frontends configuration tool.
	* configs/Kconfig: NSH_MMCSDSPIPORTNO should depend on MMCSD_SPI,
	  not just SPI (from Jose Pablo Carballo).
	* arch/arm/src/arm/Kconfig and armv7m/Kconfig:  Add an option for
	  buildroot toolchains:  They may be EABI or OABI.
	* include/nuttx/progmem and arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_flash.c:
	  Fix a counting bug plus change interface to use either relative
	  or absolut FLASH addressing (from Freddie Chopin).
	* libc/misc/Make.defs:  Fix error in conditional for KBD CODEC.
	* libc/Kconfig and configs/*/defconfig (several):  The default
	  setting should be CONFIG_LIB_KBDCODEC=n
	* tools/configure.c:  configure.c can be used to build a work-alike
	  program as a replacement for configure.sh.  This work-alike
	  program would be used in environments that do not support Bash
	  scripting (such as the Windows native environment).
	* tools/configure.bat: configure.bat is a small Windows batch
	  file that can be used as a replacement for configure.sh in a
	  Windows native environment.  configure.bat is actually just a
	  thin layer that execuates configure.exe if it is available. If
	  configure.exe is not available, then configure.bat will attempt
	  to build it first.
	* arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_syscon.h:  Correct some typos in bit
	  definitions (from Rommel Marcelo).
	* libc/string/lib_strndup.c: strndup() should use strnlen(), not
	  strlen(), to determine the size of the string.
	* sched/os_bringup.c:  Remove support for CONFIG_BUILTIN_APP_START.
	  This is not really a useful feature and creates a violation of the
	  OS layered architecture.
	* include/unistd.h, arch/arch/src/*:  Implement a simple vfork().
	  On initial checkin, this API is available only for ARM platforms.
	* binfmt/binfmt_exec.c: exec() now sets the priority of the new task
	  to the same priority as the current task (instead of the arbirtrary
	  value of 50).
	* libc/unisted/lib_execv.c and lib_execl.c:  New, somewhat flawed,
	  implementations of execv() and execl().
	* tools/cfgdefine.c:  Strips quotes from CONFIG_EXECFUNCS_SYMTAB
	  value.
	* arch/arm/include/lm3s/chip.h:  Move chip definitions into
	  public include area for compatibility with other architectures.
	* arch/arm/src/lm3s/chip:  Move register definition header files
	  into a new chip/ sub-directory.
	* arch/arm/src/lm3s/lm3s_internal.h:  Broke up into several
	  smaller header files.
	* arch/arm/src/lm:  Rename the arch/arm/src/lm3s directory to
	  arch/arm/src/lm so that is can support other members of the
	  Stellaris family.
	* libc/spawn:  Add file action interfaces needed by posix_spawn().
	* sched/clock_time2ticks.c:  Another case where time was being
	  rounded down instead of up (from Mike Smith).
	* libc/spawn:  Implementation of posix_spawn() is complete but
	  untested and undocumented.
	* drivers/usbdev/pl2303.c:  Fix typols in the PL2303 driver
	  (from Max Holtzberg).
	* configs/stm32f4discovery/posix_spawn:  Added a configuration
	  that can be used for testing posix_spawn().
	* arch/arm/src/stm32: Bring F1 support for general DMA and serial
	  DMA in paricular up to parity with F2/F4 (from Mike Smith).
	* libc/stdio/lib_libfread.c:  Correct some error handling when
	  lib_fread() was passed a bad stream.  Needed to move the
	  releasing of a semaphore inside of some conditional logic
	  (cosmetic).
	* include/nuttx/sched.h, sched/task_setup.c, and sched/task_exithook.c:
	  Add support for remembering the parent task and sending
	  SIGCHLD to the parent when the task exists.
	* sched/task_exithook.c:  Fixed a *critical* bug.  Here is
	  the scenario: (1) sched_lock() is called increments the lockcount
	  on the current TCB (i.e., the one at the head of the ready to run
	  list), (2) sched_mergepending is called which may change the task
	  at the head of the readytorun list, then (2) sched_unlock() is called
	  which decrements the lockcount on the wrong TCB.  The failure case
	  that I saw was that pre-emption got disabled in the IDLE thread,
	  locking up the whole system.
	* sched/sched_waitpid.c:  Use SIGCHLD instead of a semaphore.  This
	  is a much more spec-compliant implemenation.  However, there are
	  some issues with overruning signals because NuttX does not support
	  queueing of signals (POSIX does not require it).  I think it may
	  need to.
	* sched/sched_waitid.c and sched_wait.c:  Add support for waitid()
	  and wait().  See issues with waitpid() above.
	* include/nuttx/fs/fs.h and fs/fs_files.c:  Add a dup() method to
	  the struct mountpt_operations.  When dup'ing a file that resides
	  on a mounted volume, let the file system's dup() method do the
	  work.
	* fs/romfs/fs_romfs.c: Implemented the dup() method for the ROMFS
	  file system.
	* fs/fat/fs_fat32.c, fs/nxffs/nxffs_initialize, and
	  fs/nfs/nfs_vfsops.c:  Add hooks for dup() method (not yet
	  implemented).
	* fs/romfs:  Remove the rf_open flag.  It looks good, but actually
	  does nothing.
	* fs/fat:  Remove the ff_open flag.  Same story as for the ROMFS
	  rf_open flag.
	* fs/fat/fs_fat32.c, fs/nxffs/nxffs_initialize, and
	  fs/nfs/nfs_vfsops.c:  Completed implementation of the dup() methods.
	  There is still no good test available.
	* sched/sig_timedwait.c:  sigtimedwait() would return a bad signal
	  number if the signal was already pending when the function was
	  called.
	* configs/ubw32/scripts:  All common linker scripts moved to this
	  scripts sub-directory
	* configs/ubw32/ostest:  Configuration configured to use the
	  kconfig-frontends tools.
	* arch/mips/src/mips32/up_vfork.c, up_vfork.h, and vfork.S:
	  Implement vfork() for MIPS32 (no floating point support)
	* configs/ubw32/ostest: Enable the vfork() test.
	* fs/binfs:  Move apps/builtin/binfs.c to fs/binfs/fs_binfs.c
	  CONFIG_APPS_BINDIR rename CONFIG_FS_BINFS
	* include/nuttx/binfmt/builtin.h:  Some of the content of
	  apps/include/apps.h moved to include/nuttx/binfmt/builtin.h
	* binfmt/libbuiltin/libbuiltin_utils.c:  Move utility builtin
	  utility functions from apps/builtin/exec_builtins.c to
	  binfmt/libbuiltin/libbuiltin_utils.c
	* binfmt/builtin.c and binfmt/libbuiltin:  Add a binary "loader"
	  that can be used to execute builtin programs from the BINFS
	  file system.
	* configs/sim/nsh: Convert to use kconfig-frontends configuration
	  tool.
	* binfmt/binfmt_schedunload.c:  Add logic based on SIGCHLD to
	  automatically unload and clean-up after running a task that
	  was loaded into memory.
	* binfmt/libbuiltin: Extensions from Mike Smith
	* sched/task_reparent.c:  Add internal interface to change the
	  parent task.
	* sched/task_posixspawn():  Move libc/spawn/lib_ps.c to
	  sched/task_posixspawn() now it requires internal, reparenting
	  interfaces
	* include/nuttx/spawn():  Move libc/spawn.h to include/nuttx/spawn.h
	* arch/arm/include/lpc17xx/chip.h, irq178x.h:  Integrate Marcelo
	  Rommel's LPC1788 definitions into the base LPC17xx.
	* configs/olimex-lpc1766stk/nsh:  Convert configuration to use
	  the kconfig-frontends tools.
	* sched/task_reparent.c:  Simplify reparenting interface.
	* arch/arm/src/[many]: More LPC1788 definitions from Rommel
	  Marcelo incorporated.
	* configs/open1788:  Board configuration for the Wave Share
	  Open1788 board.  Still fragmentary (contribnuted by Rommel
	  Marcelo, adapted to use kconfig-frontends.
	* net/send():  Add logic to work around delayed ACKs by splitting
	  packets (contributed by Yan T.).
	* net/recvfrom():  Fix a bug.  When the host closes a connection
	  (gracefully).  recv[from]() returned success and the closure
	  was never detected.  Hmmm.. I don't know why the network monitor
	  did not catch this event.  This is an important bug fix.
	* net/recvfrom():  Fix a introduced with the last bugfix.  If
	  the peer does an orderly closure of the socket, report 0 not
	  -ENOTCONN
	* configs/lm3s6965-ek/README.txt and tools/:  Add an OpenOCD
	  configuration for the LM3S (from Jose Pablo Carballo).
	* nuttx/lcd/hd4478ou.h and configs/pcblogic-pic32mx/src/up_lcd1602:
	  Start of support of LCD1602 alphanumeric LCD.  I need a few
	  more parts before I can finish integrating this one.
	* arch/arm/src/*/chip.h and arch/arm/include/*/chip.h:  Move all
	  priority ranges from the src to the include chip.h header file.
	* arch/arm/include/armv7-m/irq.h:  Add inline functions to enable
	  and disable interrupts via the BASEPRI register.
	* arch/arm/Kconfig:  Add new option CONFIG_ARM7VM_USEBASEI
	* arch/arm/src/*/*_irq.c:  Set the priority of the SVCALL exception
	  to the highest possible value.
	* arch/armv7-m/up_hardfault.c:  Fail if a hardfault occurs
	  while CONFIG_ARM7VM_USEBASEPRI=y.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_serial.c:  Add support for USART
	  single wire more (Contributed by the PX4 team).
	* sched/: Implement support for retaining child task status after
	  the child task exists.  This is behavior required by POSIX.
	  But in NuttX is only enabled with CONFIG_SCHED_HAVE_PARENT and
	  CONFIG_SCHED_CHILD_STATUS
	* Add support for keyboard encode to the keypad test (from
	  Denis Carikli).
	* configs/olimex-lpc1766stk/nettest:  Configuration converted to
	  use the kconfig-frontends tools.
	* net/net_poll.c:  Split net_poll() to create psock_poll() too.
	* net/net_poll.c:  Fix poll/select issure reported by Qiang:
	  poll_interrupt() must cat call net_lostconnection() when a
	  loss of connection is reported.  Otherwise, the system will
	  not know that the connection has been lost.
	* sched/group_create.c, group_join.c, and group_leave.c:  Add
	  support for task groups.
	* sched/group_signal.c and task_exithook.c:  Send signal to all
	  members for the parent task group.
	* include/nuttx/sched.h and sched/env_*.c:  Move environment
	  variables into task group structure.
	* sched/: Lots of file changed.  Don't keep the parent task's
	  task ID in the child task's TCB.  Instead, keep the parent
	  task group IN the child task's task group.
	* fs/, sched/, include/nuttx/sched.h, and include/nutts/fs/fs.h:
	  Move file data from the TCB to the task group structure.
	* libc/stdio/, sched/, include/nuttx/lib.h, and include/nutts/fs/fs.h:
	  Move stream data from the TCB to the task group structure.
	* net/, sched/, and include/nuttx/net/net.h:  Move socket data
	  from the TCB to the task group structure.
	* sched/task_starthook.c, sched/task_start.c, and include/nuttx/sched.h:
	  Add a task start hook that will be called before the task main
	  is started. This can be used to schedule C++ constructors to run
	  automatically in the context of the new task.
	* binfmt/binfmt_execmodule: Execute constructors as a start hook.
	* sched/os_start.c: Fix ordering of group initialization.
	* configs/stm32f4discovery/usbnsh:  Add an NSH STM32F4Discovery
	  configuration that uses USB CDC/ACM for the NSH console.
	* configs/stm32f4discovery/nsh: Converted to use the kconfig-frontends
	  tools.
	* configs/*/src/up_userleds.c: Fix a error that was cloned into
	  all STM32 user LED code.  The wrong defintions were being used
	  to set LEDs on or off.
	* arch/*/common/up_internal.h and arch/*/common/up_initialize.c:
	  Serial was driver was not being built if there is no console
	  device.  Obviously, the serial driver may be needed even in
	  this case.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_serial.c: If there is a serial console,
	  it would be ttyS0 and the others would be ttyS1-5.  If there
	  is not serial console, was labeling them ttyS1-6; now labels them
	  ttyS0-5.
	* fs/fs_syslog.c: Can't handle SYSLOG output to character device from
	  the IDLE task (because it can't block). syslog_putc now returns EOF
	  on failure and sets errno.  Fixed some errors in error handling.
	* libc/stdio/lib_syslogstream.c:  Checking of return value from
	  syslog_putc was bogus.  Switching to EOF for all errors solves
	  this.
	* arch/arm/src/lm/chip/lm4f_memorymap.h: More LM4F changes from
	  Jose Pablo Carballo.
	* drivers/serial/serial.c, include/nuttx/serial/serial.h,
	  drivers/usbdev/cdcacm.c, and drivers/pl2303.c: Add support for
	  removable serial devices (like USB serial).  This support is enabled
	  by CONFIG_SERIAL_REMOVABLE and requires VBUS sensing support from
	  the board-specific logic.
	* arch/*/src/*/Toolchain.defs: Change assignment so that we can
	  override CROSSDEV with a make command line argument.
	* include/assert.h:  Mark assertion functions as non-returning.
	* arch/*/src/*/up_assert.h:  Mark _up_assert() as non-returning.
	* drivers/mtd/at25.c: When the AT25 device was not available the
	  initialization did not fail like it should. From Petteri Aimonen.
	* fs/fat/fs_configfat.c:  Fix some errors in FAT formatting logic
	  for large devices and for FAT32. From Petteri Aimonen.
	* fs/fat/fs_fat32util.c:  Fix an initialization error found by
	  Petteri Aimonen.  freecount and next freecount initialization were
	  reversed.
	* drivers/mmcsd/mmcsd_spi.c: Some SD cards will appear busy until
	  switched to SPI mode for first time.  Having a pull-up resistor on
	  MISO may avoid this problem, but this patch makes it work also
	  without pull-up.  From Petteri Aimonen.
	* fs/fat/fs_fat32.c: Fix a compilation error when FAT_DMAMEMORY=y. 
	  From Petteri Aimonen.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/chip/stm32_spi.h: STM32F4 max SPI clock freq is
	  37.5 MHz.  Patch from Petteri Aimonen.
	* arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_spi.c: Fixes for SPI DMA work on the
	  STM32F4. Includes untested additions for the F1 implementation as
	  well.  From Petteri Aimonen.
