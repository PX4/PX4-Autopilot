config LIBM
	bool "Math library"
	default n
	depends on !ARCH_MATH_H
	---help---
		By default, no math library will be provided by NuttX.  In this this case, it
		is assumed that (1) no math library is required, or (2) you will be using the
		math.h header file and the libm library provided by your toolchain.

		This is may be a very good choice is possible because your toolchain may have
		have a highly optimized version of libm.

		Another possibility is that you have a custom, architecture-specific math
		libary and that the corresponding math.h file resides at arch/<architecture>/include/math.h.
		The option is selected via ARCH_MATH_H.  If ARCH_MATH_H is selected,then the include/nuttx/math.h
 		header file will be copied to include/math.h where it can be used by your applications.

		If ARCH_MATH_H is not defined, then this option can be selected to build a generic,
		math library built into NuttX.  This math library comes from the Rhombus OS and
		was written by Nick Johnson.  The Rhombus OS math library port was contributed by
		Darcy Gong.
