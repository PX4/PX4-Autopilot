/****************************************************************************
 * Name: work_queue
 *
 * Description:
 *   Queue work to be performed at a later time.  All queued work will be
 *   performed on the worker thread of of execution (not the caller's).
 *
 *   The work structure is allocated by caller, but completely managed by
 *   the work queue logic.  The caller should never modify the contents of
 *   the work queue structure; the caller should not call work_queue()
 *   again until either (1) the previous work has been performed and removed
 *   from the queue, or (2) work_cancel() has been called to cancel the work
 *   and remove it from the work queue.
 *
 * Input parameters:
 *   work   - The work structure to queue
 *   worker - The worker callback to be invoked.  The callback will invoked
 *            on the worker thread of execution.
 *   arg    - The argument that will be passed to the workder callback when
 *            int is invoked.
 *   delay  - Delay (in clock ticks) from the time queue until the worker
 *            is invoked. Zero means to perform the work immediately.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero on success, a negated errno on failure
 *

 *
 * Description:

 *   After work has been canceled, it may be re-queue by calling work_queue()
 *   again.
 *
 * Input parameters:
 *   work   - The previously queue work structure to cancel

 * Description:

 *   user to force an immediate re-assessment of pending work.
 *
 * Input parameters:
