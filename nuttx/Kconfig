config APPS_DIR
	string "Application directory"
	default "../apps"
	---help---
		Identifies the directory that builds the
		application to link with NuttX.  Default: ../apps This symbol must be assigned
		to the path to the application build directory *relative* to
		the NuttX top build direcory. If you had an application
		directory and the NuttX directory each in separate directory
		trees like this:
		
		build
		|-nuttx
		|  |
		|  `- Makefile
		`-application
		|
		`- Makefile
		
		Then you would set CONFIG_APPS_DIR=../application.

		The application direction must contain Makefile and this make
		file must support the following targets:
		
		libapps$(LIBEXT) (usually libapps.a). libapps.a is a static
		library ( an archive) that contains all of application object
		files.
		
		clean. Do whatever is appropriate to clean the application
		directories for a fresh build.
		
		distclean. Clean everthing -- auto-generated files, symbolic
		links etc. -- so that the directory contents are the same as
		the contents in your configuration management system.
		This is only done when you change the NuttX configuration.
		
		depend. Make or update the application build dependencies.
		
		When this application is invoked it will receive the setting TOPDIR like:
		
		$(MAKE) -C $(CONFIG_APPS_DIR) TOPDIR="$(TOPDIR)" <target>
		
		TOPDIR is the full path to the NuttX directory. It can be used, for
		example, to include makefile fragments (e.g., .config or Make.defs)
		or to set up include file paths.

config BUILD_2PASS
	bool "Two pass build"
	default n
	---help---
		Enables the two pass build options.

		Two-pass build options.  If the 2 pass build option is selected, then these
		options configure the make system build a extra link object. This link object
		is assumed to be an incremental (relative) link object, but could be a static
		library (archive) (some modification to this Makefile would be required if
		CONFIG_PASS1_TARGET generates an archive). Pass 1 1ncremental (relative) link
		objects should be put into the processor-specific source directory (where other
		link objects will be created).  If the pass1 obect is an archive, it could
		go anywhere.

if BUILD_2PASS
config PASS1_TARGET
	string "Pass one target"
	default ""
	---help---
		The name of the first pass build target.  This
		can be specific build target, a special build target (all, default, etc.)
		or may just be left undefined.

config PASS1_BUILDIR
	string "Pass one build directory"
	default "build"
	---help---
		The path, relative to the top NuttX build
		directory to directory that contains the Makefile to build the
		first pass object.  The Makefile must support the following targets:
		The special target CONFIG_PASS1_TARGET (if defined)
		and the usual depend, clean, and distclean targets.

config PASS1_OBJECT
	string "Pass one object"
	default ""
	---help---
		May be used to include an extra, pass1 object
		into the final link.  This would probably be the object generated
		from the CONFIG_PASS1_TARGET.  It may be available at link time
		in the arch/<architecture>/src directory.

config NUTTX_KERNEL

config INTELHEX_BINARY
	bool "Intel HEX binary format"
	default n
	---help---
		Create the nuttx.hex in the Intel HEX binary format that is
		used with many different loaders. This option will use the GNU objcopy program
		and should not be selected if you are not using the GNU toolchain.

config MOTOROLA_SREC
	bool "Motorola S-Record binary format"
	default n
	---help---
		Create the nuttx.srec in the Motorola S-Record binary format that is
		used with many different loaders. This option will use the GNU objcopy program
		and should not be selected if you are not using the GNU toolchain.

config RAW_BINARY
	bool "Raw binary format"
	default n
	---help---
		Create the nuttx.bin in the raw binary format that is used with many
		different loaders using the GNU objcopy program.  This option
		should not be selected if you are not using the GNU toolchain.

menu "Customize Header Files"

config ARCH_STDBOOL_H
	bool "stdbool.h"
	default n
	---help---
		The stdbool.h header file can be found at nuttx/include/stdbool.h.
		However, that header includes logic to redirect the inclusion of an
		architecture specific header file like:

		#ifdef CONFIG_ARCH_STDBOOL_H
		#  include <arch/stdbool.h>
		#else
		...
		#endif

		Recall that that include path, include/arch, is a symbolic link and
		will refer to a version of stdbool.h at nuttx/arch/<architecture>/include/stdbool.h.

config ARCH_MATH_H
	bool "math.h"
	default n
	---help---
		There is also a re-directing version of math.h in the source tree.
		However, it resides out-of-the-way at include/nuttx/math.h because it
		conflicts too often with the system math.h. If ARCH_MATH_H=y is
		defined, however, the top-level makefile will copy the redirecting
 		math.h header file from include/nuttx/math.h to include/math.h. math.h
		will then include the architecture-specific version of math.h that you
		must provide at nuttx/arch/>architecture</include/math.h.

		#ifdef CONFIG_ARCH_MATH_H
		#  include <arch/math.h>
		#endif

		So for the architectures that define ARCH_MATH_H=y, include/math.h
		will be the redirecting math.h header file; for the architectures
		that don't select ARCH_MATH_H, the redirecting math.h header file
		will stay out-of-the-way in include/nuttx/.

config ARCH_FLOAT_H
	bool "float.h"
	default n
	---help---
		The float.h header file defines the properties of your floating
		point implementation.  It would always be best to use your
		toolchain's float.h header file but if none is avaiable, a default
		float.h header file will provided if this option is selected.  However
 		there is no assurance that the settings in this float.h are actually
		correct for your platform!

config ARCH_STDARG_H
	bool "stdarg.h"
	default n
	---help---
		There is also a redirecting version of stdarg.h in the source tree
		as well. It also resides out-of-the-way at include/nuttx/stdarg.h.
		This is because you should normally use your toolchain's stdarg.h
		file. But sometimes, your toolchain's stdarg.h file may have other
		header file dependencies and so may not be usable in the NuttX build
		environment. In those cases, you may have to create a architecture-
		specific stdarg.h header file at nuttx/arch/<architecture>/include/stdarg.h

		If ARCH_STDARG_H=y is defined, the top-level makefile will copy the
		re-directing stdarg.h header file from include/nuttx/stdarg.h to
		include/stdarg.h. So for the architectures that cannot use their
		toolchain's stdarg.h file, they can use this alternative by defining
		ARCH_STDARG_H=y and providing. If ARCH_STDARG_H, is not defined, then
		the stdarg.h header file will stay out-of-the-way in include/nuttx/.

menu "Debug Options"

config DEBUG
	bool "Enable Debug Features"
	default n
	---help---
		Enables built-in debug features.  Selecting this option will (1) Enable
		debug assertions in the code, (2) enable extended parameter testing in
		many functions, and (3) enable support for debug output.  Note that enabling
		this option by itself does not produce debug output.  Debug output must
		also be selected on a subsystem-by-subsystem basis.

if DEBUG
config DEBUG_VERBOSE
	bool "Enable Debug Verbose Output"
	default n
	---help---
		Enables verbose debug output (assuming debug output is enabled).  As a
		general rule, when DEBUG is enabled only errors will be reported in the debug
		output.  But if you also enable DEBUG_VERBOSE, then very chatty (and
		often annoying) output will be generated.  This means there are two levels
		of debug output:  errors-only and everything.

config DEBUG_ENABLE
	bool "Enable Debug Controls"
