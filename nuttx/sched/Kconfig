config MSEC_PER_TICK
	int "tick timer"
	default 10
	---help---
		The default system timer is 100Hz or MSEC_PER_TICK=10.  This setting
		may be defined to inform NuttX that the processor hardware is providing
		system timer interrupts at some interrupt interval other than 10 msec.

config RR_INTERVAL
	int "round robin timeslice"
	default 0
	---help---
		The round robin timeslice will be set this number of milliseconds;
		Round robin scheduling can be disabled by setting this value to zero.

	bool "Monitor system performance"
	default n
	---help---
		enables instrumentation in scheduler to monitor system performance.

config TASK_NAME_SIZE
	int "Maximum task name size"
	default 32
	---help---
		Spcifies that maximum size of a task name to save in the TCB.
		Useful if scheduler instrumentation is selected.  Set to zero to
		disable.

	bool "Enables Julian time conversions"
	default n
	---help---
		Enables Julian time conversions

	bool "Enable mutex types"
	default n

		pthread_mutexattr_settype().

	bool "Enable priority inheritance "
	default n
	---help---
		Set to enable support for priority inheritance on mutexes and semaphores. 

config SEM_PREALLOCHOLDERS 
	int "Pre-allocated holders"
	default 16
	depends on PRIORITY_INHERITANCE
	---help---
		This setting is only used if priority inheritance is enabled.
		It defines the maximum number of different threads (minus one) that
		can take counts on a semaphore with priority inheritance support.
		This may be set to zero if priority inheritance is disabled OR if you
		are only using semaphores as mutexes (only one holder) OR if no more
		than two threads participate using a counting semaphore.

config SEM_NNESTPRIO
	int "Maximum number of higher priority threads"
	default 16
	depends on PRIORITY_INHERITANCE
	---help---
		If priority inheritance is enabled, then this setting is the 
		maximum number of higher priority threads (minus 1) than can be
		waiting for another thread to release a count on a semaphore.
		This value may be set to zero if no more than one thread is
		expected to wait for a semaphore.

config FDCLONE_DISABLE
	bool "Disable cloning of file descriptors"
	default n
	---help---
	Disable cloning of all file descriptors
	by task_create() when a new task is started.  If set, all
	files/drivers will appear to be closed in the new task.

config FDCLONE_STDIO
	bool "Disable clone file descriptors without stdio"
	default n
	---help---
		Disable cloning of all but the first three file descriptors (stdin,
		stdout, stderr) by task_create() when a new task is started. If set,
		all files/drivers will appear to be closed in the new task except
		for stdin, stdout, and stderr.

config SDCLONE_DISABLE
	bool "Disable cloning of socket descriptors"
	default n
	---help---
	Disable cloning of all socket
	desciptors by task_create() when a new task is started. If
	set, all sockets will appear to be closed in the new task.

config SCHED_WORKQUEUE
	bool "Enable worker thread"
	default n
	---help---
		Create a dedicated "worker" thread to handle delayed processing from interrupt
		handlers.  This feature is required for some drivers but, if there are no
		complaints, can be safely disabled.  The worker thread also performs
		garbage collection -- completing any delayed memory deallocations from
		interrupt handlers.  If the worker thread is disabled, then that clean up will
		be performed by the IDLE thread instead (which runs at the lowest of priority
		and may not be appropriate if memory reclamation is of high priority).

config SCHED_WORKPRIORITY
	int "Worker thread priority"
	default 192
	depends on SCHED_WORKQUEUE
	---help---
		The execution priority of the worker thread.  Default: 192

		Default: 4

config SCHED_LPWORK
	bool "Enable a lower priority worker thread"
	default n
	depends on SCHED_WORKQUEUE
	---help---
		If SCHED_WORKQUEUE is defined, then a single work queue is created by
		default.  If SCHED_LPWORK is also defined then an additional, lower-
		priority work queue will also be created.  This lower priority work
		queue is better suited for more extended processing (such as file system
		clean-up operations)

config SCHED_LPWORKPRIORITY
	int "Lower priority worker thread priority"
	default 50
	depends on SCHED_LPWORK
	---help---
		The execution priority of the lopwer priority worker thread.  Default: 192

config SCHED_LPWORKPERIOD
	int "Lower priority worker thread period"

	depends on SCHED_LPWORK
	---help---
		How often the lower priority worker thread checks for work in units
		of microseconds. Default: 50*1000 (50 MS).

		Enables the atexit() API

config SCHED_ATEXIT_MAX
	int "Max number of atexit() functions"
	default 1
	depends on SCHED_ATEXIT && !SCHED_ONEXIT
	---help---
		By default if SCHED_ATEXIT is selected, only a single atexit() function
		is supported. That number can be increased by defined this setting to
		the number that you require.

		If both SCHED_ONEXIT and SCHED_ATEXIT are selected, then atexit() is built
		on top of the on_exit() implementation.  In that case, SCHED_ONEXIT_MAX
		determines the size of the combined number of atexit(0) and on_exit calls
		and SCHED_ATEXIT_MAX is not used.

config SCHED_ONEXIT
	bool "Enable on_exit() API"
	default n
	---help---
		Enables the on_exit() API

config SCHED_ONEXIT_MAX
	int "Max number of on_exit() functions"
	default 1
	depends on SCHED_ONEXIT
	---help---
		By default if SCHED_ONEXIT is selected, only a single on_exit() function
		is supported. That number can be increased by defined this setting to the
		number that you require.

		If both SCHED_ONEXIT and SCHED_ATEXIT are selected, then atexit() is built
		on top of the on_exit() implementation.  In that case, SCHED_ONEXIT_MAX
		determines the size of the combined number of atexit(0) and on_exit calls.

config USER_ENTRYPOINT
	string "Application entry point"
	default "user_start"
	---help---
		The name of the entry point for user applications.  For the example
		applications this is of the form 'app_main' where 'app' is the application
		name. If not defined, USER_ENTRYPOINT defaults to "user_start."

config DISABLE_OS_API
	bool "Disable NuttX interfaces"
	default y
	---help---
	The following can be used to disable categories of
	APIs supported by the OS.  If the compiler supports
	weak functions, then it should not be necessary to
	disable functions unless you want to restrict usage
	of those APIs.

	There are certain dependency relationships in these
	features.

	o mq_notify logic depends on signals to awaken tasks
	  waiting for queues to become full or empty.
	o pthread_condtimedwait() depends on signals to wake
	  up waiting tasks.

	bool "Disable clock interfaces"
	depends on DISABLE_OS_API
