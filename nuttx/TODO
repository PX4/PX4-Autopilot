o Task/Scheduler (sched/)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Title:       CHILD PTHREAD TERMINATION
  Description: When a tasks exits, shouldn't all of its child pthreads also be
               terminated?
  Status:      Closed.  No, this behavior will not be implemented.
  Priority:    Medium, required for good emulation of process/pthread model.

  Title:       WAIT.H
  Description: Implement sys/wait.h and functions.  Consider implementing wait,
               waitpid, waitid.  At present, a parent has no information about
               child tasks.

               Update: A simple but usable version of waitpid() has been included.
               This version is not compliant with all specifications and can be
               enabled with CONFIG_SCHED_WAITPID. 
  Status:      Open, however no further work is planned.
  Priority:    Low

  Title:       MISSING ERRNO SETTINGS
  Description: Several APIs do not set errno.  Need to review all APIs.
               Update:  These are being fixed as they are encountered.  There is
               no accounting of how many interfaces have this problem.
  Status:      Open?  There has been an effort over the past few years to assure
               that all errno settings are in place.  What is the current state?
               Unknown.
  Priority:    Medium, required for standard compliance (but makes the
               code bigger)

  Title:       TICKLESS OS
  Description: On a side note, I have thought about a tick-less timer for the OS
               for a long time.  Basically we could replace the periodic system
               timer interrupt with a one-shot interval timer programmed for the
               next interesting event time.  That is one way to both reduce the
               timer interrupt overhead and also to increase the accuracy of
               delays.

               Current timer processing is in sched/sched_processtimer.c:

               1) Calls clock_timer() which just increments a counter (the system
                  timer -- basically "up-time"). This is only used when code asks
                  for the current time.  In a tickless OS, some substitute answer
                  for the question "What time is it?" would need to be developed.
                  You could use an RTC? Or maybe logic that gets the time until the
                  next interval expiration and computes the current time. The
                  solution is not too difficult, but depends on a hardware solution.

               2) Calls wd_timer() which handles the link list of ordered events:
                  Each timer event is saved with the delta time to the next event
                  in the list. So an interval timer would be perfect to implement this.

               3) sched_process_timeslice(). Then there is round-robin time-slicing.

               The primary advantage of a tickless OS is that is would allow for
               reduce power consumptions.  That is because timer interrupts will
               usually awaken CPUs from reduced power consumption states.
  Status:      Open.  There will probably be no tickless OS implementation unless
               someone gets motivated and drives the change.
  Priority:    Low

  Title:       posix_spawn()
  Description: This would be a good interface to add to NuttX.  It is really
               just a re-packaging of the existing, non-standard NuttX exec()
               function.
  Status:      Open.  There are no plans to implement this capabilitiey now.
  Priority:    Medium low.

  Title:       pause() NON-COMPLIANCE
  Description: In the POSIX description of this function is the pause() function
               will suspend the calling thread until delivery of a signal whose
               action is either to execute a signal-catching function or to
               terminate the process.  The current implementation only waits for
               any non-blocked signal to be received.  It should only wake up if
               the signal is delivered to a handler.
  Status:      Open.
  Priority:    Medium Low.

  Title:       ON-DEMAND PAGE INCOMPLETE
  Description: On-demand paging has recently been incorporated into the RTOS.
               The design of this feature is described here:
               http://www.nuttx.org/NuttXDemandPaging.html.
               As of this writing, the basic feature implementation is
               complete and much of the logic has been verified.  The test
               harness for the feature exists only for the NXP LPC3131 (see
               configs/ea3131/pgnsh and locked directories).  There are
               some limitations of this testing so I still cannot say that
               the feature is fully functional.
  Status:      Open.  This has been put on the shelf for some time.
  Priority:    Medium-Low

  Title:       GET_ENVIRON_PTR()
  Description: get_environ_ptr() (sched/sched_getenvironptr.c) is not implemented.
               The representation of the the environment strings selected for
               NutX is not compatible with the operation.  Some significant
               re-design would be required to implement this funcion and that
               effort is thought to be not worth the result.
  Status:      Open.  No change is planned.
  Priority:    Low -- There is no plan to implement this.

  Title:       TIMER_GETOVERRUN()
  Description: timer_getoverrun() (sched/timer_getoverrun.c) is not implemented.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low -- There is no plan to implement this.

  Title:       USER-SPACE WORK QUEUES
  Description: There has been some use of work queues that has crept into some
               user code.  I am thinking of NxWidgets::CNxTimer.  That timer
               logic was originally implemented (correctly) using POSIX timers,
               but was re-implemented using timed work.

               The issue is that NxWidgets::CNxTimer is a user-space application
               but the work queues are an OS internal feature.  This will be a
               problem for KERNEL builds.  Hooks and definitions have been added
               in include/nuttx/wqueue.h to support a user-space work queue, but
               the corresponding logic has not been implemented.

               The work queue logic will need to be moved from sched/ to libc/wqueue/
  Status:      Open.  No work will probably be done until a functional KERNEL build
               that includes NxWisges::CNxTimer is needed.
  Priority:    Medium Low for now

  Title:       INCOMPATIBILITES WITH execv() AND execl()
  Description: Simplified 'execl()' and 'execv()' functions are provided by
               NuttX.  NuttX does not support processes and hence the concept
               of overlaying a tasks process image with a new process image
               does not make any sense.  In NuttX, these functions are
               wrapper functions that:

               1. Call the non-standard binfmt function 'exec', and then
               2. exit(0).

               As a result, the current implementations of 'execl()' and
               'execv()' suffer from some incompatibilities, the most
               serious of these is that the exec'ed task will not have
               the same task ID as the vfork'ed function.  So the parent
               function cannot know the ID of the exec'ed task.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium Low for now

o Memory Managment (mm/)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Title:       FREE MEMORY ON TASK EXIT
  Description: Add an option to free all memory allocated by a task when the
               task exits. This is probably not be worth the overhead for a
               deeply embedded system.

               There would be complexities with this implementation as well
               because often one task allocates memory and then passes the
               memory to another:  The task that "owns" the memory may not
               be the same as the task that allocated the memory.

               Update.  From the NuttX forum:
               ...there is a good reason why task A should never delete task B.
               That is because you will strand memory resources. Another feature
               lacking in most flat address space RTOSs is automatic memory
               clean-up when a task exits.

               That behavior just comes for free in a process-based OS like Linux:
               Each process has its own heap and when you tear down the process
               environment, you naturally destroy the heap too.

               But RTOSs have only a single, shared heap. I have spent some time
               thinking about how you could clean up memory required by a task
               when a task exits. It is not so simple. It is not as simple as
               just keeping memory allocated by a thread in a list then freeing
               the list of allocations when the task exists.

               It is not that simple because you don't know how the memory is
               being used. For example, if task A allocates memory that is used
               by task B, then when task A exits, you would not want to free that
               memory needed by task B. In a process-based system, you would
               have to explicitly map shared memory (with reference counting) in
               order to share memory. So the life of shared memory in that
               environment is easily managed.

               I have thought that the way that this could be solved in NuttX
               would be: (1) add links and reference counts to all memory allocated
               by a thread. This would increase the memory allocation overhead!
               (2) Keep the list head in the TCB, and (3) extend mmap() and munmap()
               to include the shared memory operations (which would only manage
               the reference counting and the life of the allocation).

               Then what about pthreads? Memory should not be freed until the last
               pthread in the group exists. That could be done with an additional
               reference count on the whole allocated memory list (just as streams
               and file descriptors are now shared and persist until the last
               pthread exits).

               I think that would work but to me is very unattractive and
               inconsistent with the NuttX "small footprint" objective. ...

               Other issues:
               - Memory free time would go up because you would have to remove
                 the memory from that list in free().
               - There are special cases inside the RTOS itself.  For example,
                 if task A creates task B, then initial memory allocations for
                 task B are created by task A.  Some special allocators would
                 be required to keep this memory on the correct list (or on
                 no list at all).

  Status:      Open.  No changes are planned.
  Priority:    Medium/Low, a good feature to prevent memory leaks but would
               have negative impact on memory usage and code size.

o Signals (sched/, arch/)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Title:       STANDARD SIGNALS
  Description: 'Standard' signals and signal actions are not supported.
               (e.g., SIGINT, SIGCHLD, SIGSEGV, etc).
  Status:      Open.  No changes are planned.
  Priority:    Low, required by standards but not so critical for an
               embedded system.

  Title:       SIGEV_THREAD
  Description: sig_notify() logic does not support SIGEV_THREAD; structure
               struct sigevent does not provide required members sigev_notify_function
               or sigev_notify_attributes.
  Status:      Low, there are alternative designs.  However, these features
               are required by the POSIX standard.
  Priority:    Low for now

o pthreads (sched/)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Title:       CANCELLATION POINTS
  Description: pthread_cancel():  Should implement cancellation points and
               pthread_testcancel()
  Status:      Open.  No changes are planned.
  Priority:    Low, probably not that useful

  Title:       PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT
  Description: Extended pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol() suport PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT:
               "When a thread owns one or more mutexes initialized with the
               PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT protocol, it shall execute at the higher of its
               priority  or  the  highest  of the priority ceilings of all the mutexes
               owned by this thread and initialized with this attribute, regardless of
               whether other threads are blocked on any of these mutexes or not.

               "While  a  thread is holding a mutex which has been initialized with
               the PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT or PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT protocol attributes,
               it shall not be subject to being moved to the tail of the scheduling queue
               at its priority in the event that its original priority is changed,
               such as by a call to sched_setparam(). Likewise, when a thread unlocks
               a mutex that has been initialized with the PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT or
               PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT protocol attributes, it shall not be subject to
               being moved to the tail of the scheduling queue at its priority in  the
               event that its original priority is changed."
  Status:      Open.  No changes planned.
  Priority:    Low -- about zero, probably not that useful. Priority inheritance is
               already supported and is a much better solution.  And it turns out
               that priority protection is just about as complex as priority inheritance.
               Exerpted from my post in a Linked-In discussion:

               "I started to implement this HLS/"PCP" semaphore in an RTOS that I
               work with (http://www.nuttx.org) and I discovered after doing the
               analysis and basic code framework that a complete solution for the
               case of a counting semaphore is still quite complex -- essentially
               as complex as is priority inheritance.

               "For example, suppose that a thread takes 3 different HLS semaphores
               A, B, and C. Suppose that they are prioritized in that order with
               A the lowest and C the highest. Suppose the thread takes 5 counts
               from A, 3 counts from B, and 2 counts from C. What priority should
               it run at? It would have to run at the priority of the highest
               priority semaphore C. This means that the RTOS must maintain
               internal information of the priority of every semaphore held by
               the thread.

               "Now suppose it releases one count on semaphore B. How does the
               RTOS know that it still holds 2 counts on B? With some complex
               internal data structure. The RTOS would have to maintain internal
               information about how many counts from each semaphore are held
               by each thread.

               "How does the RTOS know that it should not decrement the priority
               from the priority of C? Again, only with internal complexity. It
               would have to know the priority of every semaphore held by
               every thread.

               "Providing the HLS capability on a simple phread mutex would not
               be such quite such a complex job if you allow only one mutex per
               thread. However, the more general case seems almost as complex
               as priority inheritance. I decided that the implementation does
               not have value to me. I only wanted it for its reduced
               complexity; in all other ways I believe that it is the inferior
               solution. So I discarded a few hours of programming. Not a
               big loss from the experience I gained."

o C++ Support
  ^^^^^^^^^^^

  Title:       USE OF SIZE_T IN NEW OPERATOR
  Description: The argument of the 'new' operators should take a type of
               size_t (see libxx/libxx_new.cxx and libxx/libxx_newa.cxx).  But
               size_t has an unknown underlying.  In the nuttx sys/types.h
               header file, size_t is typed as uint32_t (which is determined by
               architecture-specific logic).  But the C++ compiler may believe
               that size_t is of a different type resulting in compilation errors
               in the operator.  Using the underlying integer type Instead of
               size_t seems to resolve the compilation issues.
  Status:      Kind of open.  There is a workaround.  Setting CONFIG_CXX_NEWLONG=y
               will define the operators with argument of type unsigned long;
               Setting CONFIG_CXX_NEWLONG=n will define the operators with argument
               of type unsigned int.  But this is pretty ugly!  A better solution
               would be to get ahold of the compilers definition of size_t.
  Priority:    Low.

  Title:       STATIC CONSTRUCTORS
  Description: Need to call static constructors
               Update:  Static constructors are implemented for the STM32 F4 and
               this will provide the model for all solutions.  Basically, if
               CONFIG_HAVE_CXXINITIALIZE=y is defined in the configuration, then
               board-specific code must provide the interface up_cxxinitialize().
               up_cxxinitialize() is called from user_start() to initialize
               all static class instances.  This TODO item probably has to stay
               open because this solution is only available on STM32 F4.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low, depends on toolchain.  Call to gcc's built-in static
               constructor logic will probably have to be performed by
               user logic in user_start().

o Binary loaders (binfmt/)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Title:       NXFLAT TESTS
  Description: Not all of the NXFLAT test under apps/examples/nxflat are working.
               Most simply do not compile yet.  tests/mutex runs okay but
               outputs garbage on completion.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    High

  Title:       ARM UP_GETPICBASE()
  Description: The ARM up_getpicbase() does not seem to work.  This means
               the some features like wdog's might not work in NXFLAT modules.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium-High

  Title:       READ-ONLY DATA IN RAM
  Description: At present, all .rodata must be put into RAM.  There is a 
               tentative design change that might allow .rodata to be placed
               in FLASH (see Documentation/NuttXNxFlat.html).
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium

  Title:       GOT-RELATIVE FUNCTION POINTERS
  Description: If the function pointer to a statically defined function is
               taken, then GCC generates a relocation that cannot be handled
               by NXFLAT.  There is a solution described in Documentataion/NuttXNxFlat.html,
               by that would require a compiler change (which we want to avoid).
               The simple workaround is to make such functions global in scope.

               That will not work for windows-based tools because they require Windows
               style paths.  The solution is to do something like this:

  Title:       TOOLCHAIN COMPATIBILITY PROBLEM
  Descripton:  The older 4.3.3 compiler generates GOTOFF relocations to the constant
               strings, like:

               .L3:
                  .word   .LC0(GOTOFF)
                  .word   .LC1(GOTOFF)
                  .word   .LC2(GOTOFF)
                  .word   .LC3(GOTOFF)
                  .word   .LC4(GOTOFF)

               Where .LC0, LC1, LC2, LC3, and .LC4 are the labels correponding to strings in
               the .rodata.str1.1 section.  One consequence of this is that .rodata must reside
               in D-Space since it will addressed relative to the GOT (see the section entitled
               "Read-Only Data in RAM" at
               http://nuttx.org/Documentation/NuttXNxFlat.html#limitations).

               The newer 4.6.3compiler generated PC relative relocations to the strings:

               .L2:
                  .word   .LC0-(.LPIC0+4)
                  .word   .LC1-(.LPIC1+4)
                  .word   .LC2-(.LPIC2+4)
                  .word   .LC3-(.LPIC4+4)
                  .word   .LC4-(.LPIC5+4)

               This is good and bad.  This is good because it means that .rodata.str1.1 can now
               reside in FLASH with .text and can be accessed using PC-relative addressing. 
               That can be accomplished by simply moving the .rodata from the .data section to
               the .text section in the linker script.  (The NXFLAT linker script is located at
               nuttx/binfmt/libnxflat/gnu-nxflat.ld).

               This is bad because a lot of stuff may get broken an a lot of test will need to
               be done.  One question that I have is does this apply to all kinds of .rodata? 
               Or just to .rodata.str1.1?
  
  Status:      Open.  Many of the required changes are in place but, unfortunately, not enough
               go be fully functional.  I think all of the I-Space-to-I-Space fixes are in place.
               However, the generated code also includes PC-relative references to .bss which
               just cannot be done.

                  Each driver should poll on TCP connections connect on the
                  network supported by the driver; UDP polling should respond
                  with TX data only if the UDP packet is intended for the
                  the network supported by the driver.

               (2) If there were multiple drivers, polling would occur at
                  double the rate.  Fix by using bound IP address in TCP
                  connection (lipaddr) and verifying that it is in the subnet
                  served by the driver.

               the data to be sent has been ACKed.
  Status:      Open.  There is some temporary logic to apps/nshlib that does

  Title:       NO POLL/SELECT ON UDP SOCKETS

  Title:       POLL/SELECT ON TCP SOCKETS NEEDS READ-AHEAD

  Title:       INTERFACES TO LEAVE/JOIN IGMP MULTICAST GROUP
  Description: The interfaces used to leave/join IGMP multicast groups is non-standard.
               RFC3678 (IGMPv3) suggests ioctl() commands to do this (SIOCSIPMSFILTER) but
               also status that those APIs are historic.  NuttX implements these ioctl
               commands, but is non-standard because:  (1) It does not support IGMPv3, and
               (2) it looks up drivers by their device name (eg., "eth0") vs IP address.

               Linux uses setsockopt() to control multicast group membership using the
               IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP and IP_DROP_MEMBERSHIP options.  It also looks up drivers
               using IP addresses (It would require additional logic in NuttX to look up
               drivers by IP address).  See http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Multicast-HOWTO-6.html

  Title:       CONFIGURATIONS WITH TINY MTUS

               This can cause problems in some networks:  CONFIG_NET_BUFSIZE should
               be set to at least 576 in all defconfig files.

               The symptoms of using very small MTU sizes can be very strange.  With
               Ubuntu 9.x and vsFtpd was that the total packet size did *not match* the
               packet size in the IP header.  This then caused a TCP checksum failure

  Title:       EP0 OUT CLASS DATA
  Description: There is no mechanism in place to handle EP0 OUT data transfers.
               There are two aspects to this problem, neither are easy to fix
               (only because of the number of drivers that would be impacted):

               1. The class drivers only send EP0 write requests and these are
                  only queued on EP0 IN by this drivers.  There is never a read
                  request queued on EP0 OUT.
               2. But EP0 OUT data could be buffered in a buffer in the driver
                  data structure.  However, there is no method currently
                  defined in the USB device interface to obtain the EP0 data.

               Updates:  (1) The USB device-to-class interface as been extended so
               that EP0 OUT data can accompany the SETUP request sent to the
               class drivers. (2) The logic in the STM32 F4 OTG FS device driver
               has been extended to provide this data.  Updates are still needed
               to other drivers.

                  the caller terminates parsing before reaching the last parameter.

                The file is created if it does not exist. The initial file
                position for reading is at the beginning of the file, but

                AFAIK, unlike for Java, division by zero is not a reliable way to

                time error, and some, such as sdcc, do. AFAIK, C implementations
                are not even required to support infinity. In C99 the macro isinf()
                could replace the first use of division by zero. Unfortunately, the
                macro INFINITY from math.h probably can't replce the second division
                by zero, since it will result in a compile-time diagnostic, if the

  Title:       AUTO-RAISE DISABLED
  Description: Auto-raise is currently disabled in NX multi-server mode.  The
               reason is complex:
               - Most touchscreen controls send touch data a high rates
               - In multi-server mode, touch events get queued in a message
                  queue.
               - The logic that receives the messages performs the auto-raise.
                 But it can do stupid things after the first auto-raise as
                 it opperates on the stale data in the message queue.
               I am thinking that auto-raise ought to be removed from NuttX
               and moved out into a graphics layer (like NxWM) that knows
               more about the appropriate context to do the autoraise.

               have a separate font cache.  This is inefficient and wasteful
               of memory:  Each NxConsole instance should share a common font
               cache.

               syscalls), the single user mode cannot be supported.  In this
               built configuration, only the multiple user mode can be supported
               with the NX server residing inside of the kernel space.  In
               this case, most of the user end functions in graphics/nxmu
               must be moved to libc/nx and those functions must be built into
               libuser.a to be linked with the user-space code.
               A similar issue exists in NSH that uses some internal OS

  Title:       mconf NOT AVAILABLE IN NATIVE WINDOWS BUILD
  Description: NuttX is migrating to the use of the kconfig-frontends mconf
               tool for all configurations.  In NuttX 6.24, support for native
               Windows builds was added.  However, the mconf tool does not
               build to run natively under Windows.

               Some effort was spent trying to get a clean mconf build under
               Windows.  This is documented in the message thread beginning
               here: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/nuttx/message/2900.
               The build was successfully completed using:  MinGW-GCC, MSYS,
               additional Windows libraries, and additional MSYS libraries
               (MSYS is a variant of Cygwin so, presumeably, Cygwin could
               have been used as well).  However, on final testing, it was
               found that there are problems with text and numeric entry:
               http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/nuttx/message/2953.  This
               was considered a show stopper and the changs were not checked
               in.

               Options:  (1) Use conf (not mconf).  confis the text-only
               configuration tool, (2) fix mconf, (3) write another variant
               of the configuration tool for windows, or (4) do all configuration
               under Cygwin or MSYS.  I am doing (4) now, but this is very
               awkward because I have to set the apps path to ../apps (vs
               ..\apps) and CONFIG_WINDOWS_NATIVE=n for the 'make menuconfig'
               to run error free under windows.  Very awkward!

               will stall for a long time on reads when the C stdio buffers are
               being refilled. This only effects the behavior of things like
               fgetc().  Workaround: Set CONFIG_STDIO_BUFFER_SIZE=0, suppressing

               NIC, but I never got it correctly integrated with the NuttX networking.
               NOTE: On Cygwin, the build uses the Cygwin WPCAP library and is, at

  Title:       ROUND-ROBIN SCHEDULING IN THE SIMULATOR

               "faked" during IDLE loop processing and, as a result, there is no
               task pre-emption because there are no asynchrous events.  This could
               probably be fixed if the "timer interrupt" were driver by Linux
               signals. NOTE:  You would also have to implement irqsave() and
               irqrestore() to block and (conditionally) unblock the signal.

  Title:       NSH ISSUES ON THE SIMULATOR
  Descripion:  The NSH example has some odd behaviors.  Mult-tasking -- for example,
               execution of commands in background -- does not work normally.  This
               is due to the fact that NSH uses the system standard input for the
               console.  This means that the simulation is actually "frozen" all of
               the time when NSH is waiting for input and background commands never
               get the chance to run.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    This will not be fixed.  This is the normal behavior in the current
               design of the simulator.  "Real" platforms will behave correctly
               because NSH will "sleep" when it waits for console inpu and other
               tasks can run freely.

  Title:       DOUBLE COMMAND ECHO
  Description: In the NSH example, the host HOST echoes each command so after you
               you enter a command, the command is repeated on the next line.  This
               is an artifact of the simulator only.

  Title:       IMPROVED ARM INTERRUPT HANDLING
  Description: ARM interrupt handling performance could be improved in some
               ways. One easy way is to use a pointer to the context save
               area in current_regs instead of using up_copystate so much.
               see handling of 'current_regs" in arch/arm/src/armv7-m/* for

  Title:       IMPROVED ARM INTERRUPT HANDLING

               upon return. This could be improved as well:  If there is no
               context switch, then the static registers need not be restored
               because they will not be modified by the called C code.

  Title:       SVCALLS AND HARDFAULTS
  Description: The Cortex-M3 user context switch logic uses SVCall instructions.
               This user context switching time could be improved by eliminating
               the SVCalls and developing assembly language implementations
               of the context save and restore logic.
               Also, because interrupts are always disabled when the SVCall is
               executed, the SVC goes to the hard fault handler where it must
               be handled as a special case.  I recall seeing some controls
               somewhere that will allow to suppress one hard fault.  I don't 
               recall the control, but something like this should be used before
               executing the SVCall so that it vectors directly to the SVC
               handler.
               Another, more standard option would be to use interrupt priority
               levels to control interrupts.  In that case, (1) The SVC would
               be the highest priority interrupt (0), (2) irqsave() would set
               the interrupt mask level to just above that, and (2) irqrestore
               would restore the interrupt level.  This would not be diffult,
               but does affect a lot of files!

               fine because everything is in kernel-mode.  In an operating model
               where applications run in user mode and interrupts/traps run in
               kernel-mode, I think that there is a problem with this.  This would
               like be a problem, for example, if for a kernel build where NuttX
               is built as a monolithic, protected kernel and user mode programs

  Title:       CORTEX-M3 STACK OVERFLOW
  Description: There is bit bit logic inf up_fullcontextrestore() that executes on
               return from interrupts (and other context switches) that looks like:

                 ldr r1, [r0, #(4*REG_CPSR)] /* Fetch the stored CPSR value */
                 msr cpsr, r1 /* Set the CPSR */

                 /* Now recover r0 and r1 */

                 ldr r0, [sp]
                 ldr r1, [sp, #4]
                 add sp, sp, #(2*4)

                 /* Then return to the address at the stop of the stack,
                  * destroying the stack frame
                  */

                 ldr pc, [sp], #4

               Under conditions of excessivley high interrupt conditions, many
               nested interrupts can oocur just after the 'msr cpsr' instruction.
               At that time, there are 4 bytes on the stack and, with each
               interrupt, the stack pointer may increment and possibly overflow.

               This can happen only under conditions of continuous interrupts.
               See this email thread: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/nuttx/message/1261
               On suggested change is:

                 ldmia     r0, {r0-r15}^

                  that sufficient protection is in place to handler the nested
                  interrupts, or
               3) Return from the exception via a trampoline (such as is
                  currently done for signal handlers).  In the trampoline,
                  the trap would processed in supervisor mode with interrupts

               - Host-side of the test started after the target side sends the
                 first serial message.

               The general failure is as follows:

               - The target message pends in the endpoint packet memory
               - When the host-side of the test is stated, it correctly
                 reads this pending data.
               - an EP correct transfer interrupt occurs and the next
                 pending outgoing message is setup
               - But, the host never receives the next message

               If the host-side driver is started before the first target message
               is sent, the driver works fine.

               where bursts must not cross the 1 KB address boundary because the
               minimum address space that can be allocated to a single slave
               is 1 KB. This means that the 1 KB address boundary should not be crossed
               by a burst block transfer, otherwise an AHB error would be generated,
               that is not reported by the DMA registers."

               The implication is that there may be some unenforced alignment
               requirements for some DMAs.  There is nothing in the DMA driver to

                generate a lot of string data.  The build system currently places all
                string data in RAM and the string data can easily overflow the tiny
                SRAMs on these parts.  A solution would be to put the string data
                into the more abundant FLASH memory, but this would require modification
                to the printf logic to access the strings from program memory.

  Title:       PIC32 USB DRIVER DOES NOT WORK WITH MASS STORAGE CLASS
               UPDATE:  ** ONLY USING RAM DISK FOR EXPORTED VOLUME ***
  Description: The PIC32 USB driver either crashes or hangs when used with
               the mass storage class when trying to write files to the target
               storage device.  This usually works with debug on, but does not
               work with debug OFF (implying some race condition?)

               Here are some details of what I see in debugging:

               1. The USB MSC device completes processing of a read request
                  and returns the read request to the driver.
               2. Before the MSC device can even begin the wait for the next
                  driver, many packets come in at interrupt level.  The MSC
                  device goes to sleep (on pthread_cond_wait) with all of the
                  read buffers ready (16 in my test case).
               3. The pthread_cond_wait() does not wake up.  This implies
                  a problem with pthread_con_wait(?).  But in other cases,
                  the MSC device does wake up, but then immediately crashes
                  because its stack is bad.
               4. If I force the pthread_cond_wait to wake up (by using
                  pthread_cond_timedwait instead), then the thread wakes
                  up and crashes with a bad stack.

               So far, I have no clue why this is failing.

               UPDATE:  This bug was recorded using the PIC32 Ethernet
               Starter kit with a RAM disk (that board has no SD card slot).
               Howevever, using the USB mass storage device with the
               Mikroelektronika using a real SD card, there is no such
               problem -- the mass storage device seems quite stable.

               UPDATE:  Hmmm.. retesting with the Mikroelectronka board
               shows problems again.  I think that there are some subtle
               timing bugs whose effects can very from innocuous to severe.

               Some odd behavior in the interrupt setup on the IDLE loop is
               not really a big concern, but what I do not understand is if
               this behavior is occurring on all threads after all context
               switches:  Are interrupts always disabled until re-enabled?
               This requires some further investigation at some point; it
               may be nothing but may also be a symptom of some changes
               required to the interrupt return logic (perhaps some CP0
               status hazard?)
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low. Puzzling and needs some investigation, but there there

o Hitachi/Renesas SH-1 (arch/sh/src/sh1)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Title:        SH-1 IS UNUSABLE
  Description:  There are instabilities that make the SH-1 port un-usable.  The
                nature of these is not understood; the behavior is that certain SH-1
                instructions stop working as advertised.  I have seen the following
                examples:

                  412b jmp @r1 - Set a return address in PR, i.e., it behaved like
                       410b jsr @r1.  Normally 412b works correctly, but in the failure
                       condition, it reliably set the PR.
                  69F6 mov.l @r15+,r9 - wrote the value of R1 to @r15+.  This behavior
                       does not correspond to any known SH-1 instruction

                This could be a silicon problem, some pipeline issue that is not
                handled properly by the gcc 3.4.5 toolchain (which has very limit
                SH-1 support to begin with), or perhaps with the CMON debugger.  At
                any rate, I have exhausted all of the energy that I am willing to put
                into this cool old processor for the time being.

                Update:  This bug will probably never be addressed now.  I just
                cleaned house and my old SH-1 was one of the things that went.

               SYSIO 0, WRITESTR a large case statement is executed.  This
               involves a call into the ZiLOG runtime library to __uwcase().
               __uwcase is passed a pointer to a structure containing jump
               information.  The cause of the failure appears to be that
               the referenced switch data is bad.

               If the customer does not want to modify uwcase.asm then the other
