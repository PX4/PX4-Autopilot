config NET_NOINTS
	bool "Not interrupt driven"
	default n
	---help---
		NET_NOINT indicates that uIP is not called from the interrupt level. 
		If NET_NOINTS is defined, critical sections will be managed with semaphores;
		Otherwise, it assumed that uIP will be called from interrupt level handling
		and critical sections will be managed by enabling and disabling interrupts.

config NET_MULTIBUFFER
	bool "Use multiple device-side I/O buffers"
	default n
	---help---
		Traditionally, uIP has used a single buffer for all incoming and
		outgoing traffic.  If this configuration is selected, then the
		driver can manage multiple I/O buffers and can, for example,
		be filling one input buffer while sending another output buffer.
		Or, as another example, the driver may support queuing of concurrent
		input/ouput and output transfers for better performance.

config NET_IPv6
	bool "IPv6"
	default n
	---help---
		Build in support for IPv6.  Not fully implemented.

config NSOCKET_DESCRIPTORS

	default 8
	---help---
		Maximum number of socket descriptors per task/thread.

config NET_NACTIVESOCKETS
	int "Max socket operations"
	default 16
	---help---
		Maximum number of concurrent socket operations (recv, send, etc.).
		Default: 16

config NET_SOCKOPTS
	bool "Socket options"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable or disable support for socket options

config NET_BUFSIZE
	int "Network packet size"
	default 562 if !NET_TCP && NET_UDP && !NET_SLIP
	default 420 if NET_TCP && !NET_UDP && !NET_SLIP
	default 296 if NET_SLIP
	---help---
		uIP buffer size.  Default: 562

config NET_TCPURGDATA
	bool "Urgent data"
	default n
	---help---
		Determines if support for TCP urgent data notification should be
		compiled in. Urgent data (out-of-band data) is a rarely used TCP feature
		that is very seldom would be required.

menu "TCP/IP Networking"

config NET_TCP
	bool "TCP/IP Networking"
	default n
	---help---
		TCP support on or off

if NET_TCP
config NET_TCP_CONNS
	int "Number of TCP/IP connections"
	default 8
	---help---
		Maximum number of TCP/IP connections (all tasks)

config NET_MAX_LISTENPORTS
	int "Number of listening ports"
	default 20
	---help---
		Maximum number of listening TCP/IP ports (all tasks).  Default: 20

config NET_TCP_READAHEAD_BUFSIZE
	int "TCP/IP read-ahead buffer size"
	default 562
	---help---
		Read-ahead buffers allows buffering of TCP/IP packets when there is no
		receive in place to catch the TCP packet.  In that case, the packet
		will be retained in the NuttX read-ahead buffers.

		This setting specifies the size of one TCP/IP read-ahead buffer.
		This should best be a equal to the maximum packet size (NET_BUFSIZE).

config NET_NTCP_READAHEAD_BUFFERS
	int "Number of TCP/IP read-ahead buffers"
	default 8
	---help---
		Read-ahead buffers allows buffering of TCP/IP packets when there is no
		receive in place to catch the TCP packet.  In that case, the packet
		will be retained in the NuttX read-ahead buffers.

		This setting specifies the number of TCP/IP read-ahead buffers  This
		value can be set to zero to disable all TCP/IP read-ahead buffering.
		You might want to disable TCP/IP read-ahead buffering on a highly
		memory constained system that does not have any TCP/IP packet rate
		issues.

config NET_TCP_RECVDELAY
	int "TCP Rx delay"
	default 0
	---help---
		If NET_NTCP_READAHEAD_BUFFERS is zero, then there will be no buffering
		of TCP/IP packets:  Any TCP/IP packet received will be ACKed, but its contents
		will be dropped in the bit-bucket.

		One low-performance option is delay for a short period of time after a
		TCP/IP packet is received to see if another comes right behind it. Then
		the packet data from both can be combined.  This option only makes since
		if performance is not an issue and you need to handle short bursts of
		small, back-to-back packets.  The delay is in units of deciseconds.

config NET_TCPBACKLOG
	bool "TCP/IP backlog support"
	default n
	---help---
		Incoming connections pend in a backlog until accept() is called.
		The size of the backlog is selected when listen() is called.

config NET_TCP_SPLIT
	bool "Enable packet splitting"
	default n
	---help---
		send() will not return until the the transfer has been ACKed by the
		recipient.  But under RFC 1122, the host need not ACK each packet
		immediately; the host may wait for 500 MS before ACKing.  This
		combination can cause very slow performance with small transfers are
		made to an RFC 1122 client.  However, the RFC 1122 must ACK at least
		every second (odd) packet.

		This option enables logic to trick the RFC 1122 host be exploiting
		this last RFC 1122 requirement:  If an odd number of packets were to
		be sent, then send() will split the last even packet to guarantee
		that an even number of packets will be sent and the RFC 1122 host
		will ACK the final packet immediately.

if NET_TCP_SPLIT

config NET_TCP_SPLIT_SIZE
	int "Split size threshold"
	default 40
	---help---
		Packets of this size or smaller than this will not be split.

		Enable IGMPv2 client support.

if NET_IGMP
config PREALLOC_IGMPGROUPS
	int "Number of pre-allocated IGMP groups"
	default 4
	---help---
		Pre-allocated IGMP groups are used only if needed from interrupt
		level group created (by the IGMP server). Default: 4.

endif

if NET

config NET_STATISTICS
	bool "Collect network statistics"
	default n
	---help---
		uIP statistics on or off

config NET_RECEIVE_WINDOW
	int "Receive window size"
	default 562
	---help---
		The size of the advertised receiver's window.   Should be set low
		(i.e., to the size of the NET_BUFSIZE) if the application is slow
		to process incoming data, or high (32768 bytes) if the application
		processes data quickly.

config NET_ARPTAB_SIZE

	bool "Multi-cast Tx support"
	default n
	---help---
		Outgoing multi-cast address support

config NET_SLIP
	bool "SLIP support"
	default n
	---help---
		Enables building of the SLIP driver. SLIP requires
		at least one IP protocol selected and the following additional
		network settings: NET_NOINTS and NET_MULTIBUFFER.

		NET_BUFSIZE *must* be set to 296.  Other optional configuration
		settings that affect the SLIP driver: NET_STATISTICS. 
		Default: Ethernet

		SLIP supports point-to-point IP communications over a serial port.
		The default data link layer for uIP is Ethernet. If NET_SLIP is
		defined in the NuttX configuration file, then SLIP will be supported.
		The basic differences between the SLIP and Ethernet configurations is
		that when SLIP is selected: 
		
		* The link level header (that comes before the IP header) is omitted. 
		* All MAC address processing is suppressed. 
		* ARP is disabled.
		
		If NET_SLIP is not selected, then Ethernet will be used (there is
		no need to define anything special in the configuration file to use
		Ethernet -- it is the default).
