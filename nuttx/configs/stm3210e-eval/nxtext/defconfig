# architecture selection
#
# CONFIG_ARCH - identifies the arch subdirectory and, hence, the
#   processor architecture.
# CONFIG_ARCH_family - for use in C code.  This identifies the
#   particular chip family that the architecture is implemented
#   in.
# CONFIG_ARCH_architecture - for use in C code.  This identifies the
#   specific architecture within the chip familyl.
# CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP - Identifies the arch/*/chip subdirectory

# CONFIG_ARCH_LOWPUTC - architecture supports low-level, boot
#   time console output
# CONFIG_MSEC_PER_TICK - The default system timer is 100Hz
#   or MSEC_PER_TICK=10.  This setting may be defined to
#   inform NuttX that the processor hardware is providing
#   system timer interrupts at some interrupt interval other
#   than 10 msec.

#   instrumentation is selected.  Set to zero to disable.
# CONFIG_START_YEAR, CONFIG_START_MONTH, CONFIG_START_DAY -

# CONFIG_DEV_LOWCONSOLE - Use the simple, low-level serial console
#   driver (minimul support)
# CONFIG_MUTEX_TYPES: Set to enable support for recursive and
#   errorcheck mutexes. Enables pthread_mutexattr_settype().
# CONFIG_PRIORITY_INHERITANCE : Set to enable support for priority
#   inheritance on mutexes and semaphores. 
# CONFIG_SEM_PREALLOCHOLDERS: This setting is only used if priority
#   inheritance is enabled.  It defines the maximum number of
#   different threads (minus one) that can take counts on a
#   semaphore with priority inheritance support.  This may be 
#   set to zero if priority inheritance is disabled OR if you
#   are only using semaphores as mutexes (only one holder) OR
#   if no more than two threads participate using a counting
#   semaphore.
# CONFIG_SEM_NNESTPRIO.  If priority inheritance is enabled,

#   three file descriptors (stdin, stdout, stderr) by task_create()
#   when a new task is started. If set, all files/drivers will
#   appear to be closed in the new task except for stdin, stdout,
#   and stderr.
# CONFIG_SDCLONE_DISABLE. Disable cloning of all socket
#   desciptors by task_create() when a new task is started. If
#   set, all sockets will appear to be closed in the new task.
# CONFIG_SCHED_WORKQUEUE.  Create a dedicated "worker" thread to
#  handle delayed processing from interrupt handlers.  This feature
#  is required for some drivers but, if there are not complaints,
#  can be safely disabled.  The worker thread also performs
#  garbage collection -- completing any delayed memory deallocations
#  from interrupt handlers.  If the worker thread is disabled,
#  then that clean will be performed by the IDLE thread instead
#  (which runs at the lowest of priority and may not be appropriate
#  if memory reclamation is of high priority).  If CONFIG_SCHED_WORKQUEUE
#  is enabled, then the following options can also be used:
# CONFIG_SCHED_WORKPRIORITY - The execution priority of the worker
#  thread.  Default: 50
# CONFIG_SCHED_WORKPERIOD - How often the worker thread checks for
#  work in units of microseconds.  Default: 50*1000 (50 MS).
# CONFIG_SCHED_WORKSTACKSIZE - The stack size allocated for the worker
#  thread.  Default: CONFIG_IDLETHREAD_STACKSIZE.
# CONFIG_SIG_SIGWORK - The signal number that will be used to wake-up
#  the worker thread.  Default: 4

#   patents on FAT long file name technology.  Please read the
#   disclaimer in the top-level COPYING file and only enable this
#   feature if you understand these issues.
# CONFIG_FAT_MAXFNAME - If CONFIG_FAT_LFN is defined, then the
#   default, maximum long file name is 255 bytes.  This can eat up
#   a lot of memory (especially stack space).  If you are willing
#   to live with some non-standard, short long file names, then
#   define this value.  A good choice would be the same value as
#   selected for CONFIG_NAME_MAX which will limit the visibility
#   of longer file names anyway.
# CONFIG_FS_NXFFS: Enable NuttX FLASH file system (NXFF) support.
# CONFIG_NXFFS_ERASEDSTATE: The erased state of FLASH.

# CONFIG_NXFFS_PACKTHRESHOLD: When packing flash file data,
#   don't both with file chunks smaller than this number of data bytes.
#   Default: 32.
# CONFIG_NXFFS_TAILTHRESHOLD: clean-up can either mean
#   packing files together toward the end of the file or, if file are
#   deleted at the end of the file, clean up can simply mean erasing
#   the end of FLASH memory so that it can be re-used again.  However,
#   doing this can also harm the life of the FLASH part because it can
#   mean that the tail end of the FLASH is re-used too often. This
#   threshold determines if/when it is worth erased the tail end of FLASH
#   and making it available for re-use (and possible over-wear).
#   Default: 8192.
# CONFIG_FS_ROMFS - Enable ROMFS filesystem support

# NxConsole Configuration Settings:
#
# CONFIG_NXCONSOLE
#   Enables building of the NxConsole driver.
# CONFIG_NXCONSOLE_BPP
#   Currently, NxConsole supports only a single pixel depth. This
#   configuration setting must be provided to support that single pixel depth.
#   Default: The smallest enabled pixel depth. (see CONFIG_NX_DISABLE_*BPP)
# CONFIG_NXCONSOLE_NOGETRUN
#   NxConsole needs to know if it can read from the LCD or not. If reading
#   from the LCD is supported, then NxConsole can do more efficient
#   scrolling. Default: Supported
# CONFIG_NXCONSOLE_MXCHARS
#   NxConsole needs to remember every character written to the console so
#   that it can redraw the window. This setting determines the size of some
#   internal memory allocations used to hold the character data. Default: 128.
# CONFIG_NXCONSOLE_CACHESIZE
#   NxConsole supports caching of rendered fonts. This font caching is required
#   for two reasons: (1) First, it improves text performance, but more
#   importantly (2) it preserves the font memory. Since the NX server runs on
#   a separate server thread, it requires that the rendered font memory persist
#   until the server has a chance to render the font. (NOTE: There is still
#   inherently a race condition in this!). Unfortunately, the font cache would
#   be quite large if all fonts were saved. The CONFIG_NXCONSOLE_CACHESIZE setting
#   will control the size of the font cache (in number of glyphs). Only that
#   number of the most recently used glyphs will be retained. Default: 16.
# CONFIG_NXCONSOLE_LINESEPARATION
#   This the space (in rows) between each row of test.  Default: 2
# CONFIG_NXCONSOLE_NOWRAP
#   By default, lines will wrap when the test reaches the right hand side
#   of the window. This setting can be defining to change this behavior so
#   that the text is simply truncated until a new line is  encountered.

# CONFIG_LCD_PORTRAIT - Define for 240x320 display "portrait"
#   orientation support.  In this orientation, the STM3210E-EVAL's
#   LCD ribbon cable is at the bottom of the display. Default is
#   320x240 "landscape" orientation.
# CONFIG_LCD_RPORTRAIT - Define for 240x320 display "reverse
#   portrait" orientation support.  In this orientation, the
#   STM3210E-EVAL's LCD ribbon cable is at the top of the display.
#   Default is 320x240 "landscape" orientation.
# CONFIG_LCD_BACKLIGHT - Define to support a backlight.
# CONFIG_LCD_PWM - If CONFIG_STM32_TIM1 is also defined, then an
#   adjustable backlight will be provided using timer 1 to generate
#   various pulse widthes.  The granularity of the settings is
#   determined by CONFIG_LCD_MAXPOWER.  If CONFIG_LCD_PWM (or

# Settings for examples/watchdog
#
# This test depends on these specific Watchdog/NSH configurations settings (your
# specific watchdog hardware settings might require additional settings).
#
#   CONFIG_WATCHDOG- Enables watchdog timer support support.
#   CONFIG_NSH_BUILTIN_APPS - Build the watchdog time test as an NSH
#     built-in function. Default: Not built!  The example can only be used
#     as an NSH built-in application
#
# The STM32 also needs one of the following enabled:
#
#  CONFIG_STM32_WWDG=y, OR
#  CONFIG_STM32_IWDG=y (but not both)
#
# Specific configuration options for this example include:
#
# CONFIG_EXAMPLES_WATCHDOG_DEVPATH - The path to the Watchdog device.
#   Default: /dev/watchdog0
# CONFIG_EXAMPLES_WATCHDOG_PINGTIME - Time in milliseconds that the example
#   will ping the watchdog before letting the watchdog expire. Default: 5000
#   milliseconds
# CONFIG_EXAMPLES_WATCHDOG_PINGDELAY - Time delay between pings in
#   milliseconds. Default: 500 milliseconds.
# CONFIG_EXAMPLES_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT - The watchdog timeout value in
#   milliseconds before the watchdog timer expires.  Default:  2000
#   milliseconds.

# Stack and heap information
#
# CONFIG_BOOT_RUNFROMFLASH - Some configurations support XIP
#   operation from FLASH but must copy initialized .data sections to RAM.
#   (should also be =n for the STM3210E-EVAL which always runs from flash)
# CONFIG_BOOT_COPYTORAM -  Some configurations boot in FLASH
#   but copy themselves entirely into RAM for better performance.
# CONFIG_CUSTOM_STACK - The up_ implementation will handle
#   all stack operations outside of the nuttx model.
# CONFIG_STACK_POINTER - The initial stack pointer (arm7tdmi only)
# CONFIG_IDLETHREAD_STACKSIZE - The size of the initial stack.
#  This is the thread that (1) performs the inital boot of the system up
#  to the point where user_start() is spawned, and (2) there after is the
#  IDLE thread that executes only when there is no other thread ready to
#  run.
# CONFIG_USERMAIN_STACKSIZE - The size of the stack to allocate
#  for the main user thread that begins at the user_start() entry point.
# CONFIG_PTHREAD_STACK_MIN - Minimum pthread stack size
# CONFIG_PTHREAD_STACK_DEFAULT - Default pthread stack size
# CONFIG_HEAP_BASE - The beginning of the heap
# CONFIG_HEAP_SIZE - The size of the heap
