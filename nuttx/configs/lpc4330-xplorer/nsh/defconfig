# CONFIG_ARCH_family - for use in C code.  This identifies the
#   particular chip family that the architecture is implemented
#   in.
# CONFIG_ARCH_architecture - for use in C code.  This identifies the

# CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP - Identifies the arch/*/chip subdirectory
# CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP_name - For use in C code
# CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD - identifies the configs subdirectory and, hence,

# CONFIG_BOARD_LOOPSPERMSEC - for delay loops
# CONFIG_DRAM_SIZE - Describes the installed DRAM.
# CONFIG_DRAM_START - The start address of DRAM (physical)
# CONFIG_DRAM_END - Last address+1 of installed RAM
# CONFIG_ARCH_IRQPRIO - The Cortex-M4 supports interrupt prioritization
# CONFIG_ARCH_FPU - The Cortex-M4 supports a floating point unit (FPU)
#   (But, unfortunately, most versions of GCC do not support it).
# CONFIG_ARCH_INTERRUPTSTACK - This architecture supports an interrupt
#   stack. If defined, this symbol is the size of the interrupt
#   stack in bytes.  If not defined, the user task stacks will be
#   used during interrupt handling.

# CONFIG_ARCH_CALIBRATION - Enables some build in instrumentation that
#   cause a 100 second delay during boot-up.  This 100 second delay
#   serves no purpose other than it allows you to calibrate
#   CONFIG_BOARD_LOOPSPERMSEC.  You simply use a stop watch to measure
#   the 100 second delay then adjust CONFIG_BOARD_LOOPSPERMSEC until

# CONFIG_HAVE_CXXINITIALIZE - The platform-specific logic includes support
#   for initialization of static C++ instances for this architecture
#   and for the selected toolchain (via up_cxxinitialize()).
# CONFIG_MM_REGIONS - If the architecture includes multiple
#   regions of memory to allocate from, this specifies the
#   number of memory regions that the memory manager must
#   handle and enables the API mm_addregion(start, end);
# CONFIG_ARCH_LOWPUTC - architecture supports low-level, boot

# CONFIG_MUTEX_TYPES: Set to enable support for recursive and
#   errorcheck mutexes. Enables pthread_mutexattr_settype().
# CONFIG_PRIORITY_INHERITANCE : Set to enable support for priority
#   inheritance on mutexes and semaphores. 
# CONFIG_SEM_PREALLOCHOLDERS: This setting is only used if priority
#   inheritance is enabled.  It defines the maximum number of
#   different threads (minus one) that can take counts on a
#   semaphore with priority inheritance support.  This may be 
#   set to zero if priority inheritance is disabled OR if you
#   are only using semaphores as mutexes (only one holder) OR
#   if no more than two threads participate using a counting
#   semaphore.
# CONFIG_SEM_NNESTPRIO.  If priority inheritance is enabled,
#   then this setting is the maximum number of higher priority
#   threads (minus 1) than can be waiting for another thread

#   to zero if no more than one thread is expected to wait for
#   a semaphore.
# CONFIG_FDCLONE_DISABLE. Disable cloning of all file descriptors
#   by task_create() when a new task is started.  If set, all
#   files/drivers will appear to be closed in the new task.
# CONFIG_FDCLONE_STDIO. Disable cloning of all but the first
#   three file descriptors (stdin, stdout, stderr) by task_create()
#   when a new task is started. If set, all files/drivers will
#   appear to be closed in the new task except for stdin, stdout,
#   and stderr.
# CONFIG_SDCLONE_DISABLE. Disable cloning of all socket
#   desciptors by task_create() when a new task is started. If
#   set, all sockets will appear to be closed in the new task.
# CONFIG_SCHED_WORKQUEUE.  Create a dedicated "worker" thread to
#  handle delayed processing from interrupt handlers.  This feature
#  is required for some drivers but, if there are not complaints,
#  can be safely disabled.  The worker thread also performs
#  garbage collection -- completing any delayed memory deallocations
#  from interrupt handlers.  If the worker thread is disabled,
#  then that clean will be performed by the IDLE thread instead
#  (which runs at the lowest of priority and may not be appropriate
#  if memory reclamation is of high priority).  If CONFIG_SCHED_WORKQUEUE
#  is enabled, then the following options can also be used:
# CONFIG_SCHED_WORKPRIORITY - The execution priority of the worker
#  thread.  Default: 50
# CONFIG_SCHED_WORKPERIOD - How often the worker thread checks for
#  work in units of microseconds.  Default: 50*1000 (50 MS).
# CONFIG_SCHED_WORKSTACKSIZE - The stack size allocated for the worker
#  thread.  Default: CONFIG_IDLETHREAD_STACKSIZE.
# CONFIG_SIG_SIGWORK - The signal number that will be used to wake-up
#  the worker thread.  Default: 4

# CONFIG_SYSLOG - Enables the System Logging feature.
# CONFIG_RAMLOG - Enables the RAM logging feature
# CONFIG_RAMLOG_CONSOLE - Use the RAM logging device as a system console.
#   If this feature is enabled (along with CONFIG_DEV_CONSOLE), then all
#   console output will be re-directed to a circular buffer in RAM.  This
#   is useful, for example, if the only console is a Telnet console.  Then

# Filesystem configuration
#
# CONFIG_FS_FAT - Enable FAT filesystem support
# CONFIG_FAT_SECTORSIZE - Max supported sector size
# CONFIG_FAT_LCNAMES - Enable use of the NT-style upper/lower case 8.3
#   file name support.
# CONFIG_FAT_LFN - Enable FAT long file names.  NOTE:  Microsoft claims
#   patents on FAT long file name technology.  Please read the
#   disclaimer in the top-level COPYING file and only enable this
#   feature if you understand these issues.
# CONFIG_FAT_MAXFNAME - If CONFIG_FAT_LFN is defined, then the
#   default, maximum long file name is 255 bytes.  This can eat up
#   a lot of memory (especially stack space).  If you are willing
#   to live with some non-standard, short long file names, then
#   define this value.  A good choice would be the same value as
#   selected for CONFIG_NAME_MAX which will limit the visibility
#   of longer file names anyway.
# CONFIG_FS_NXFFS: Enable NuttX FLASH file system (NXFF) support.
# CONFIG_NXFFS_ERASEDSTATE: The erased state of FLASH. 
#   This must have one of the values of 0xff or 0x00.
#   Default: 0xff.
# CONFIG_NXFFS_PACKTHRESHOLD: When packing flash file data,
#   don't both with file chunks smaller than this number of data bytes.
# CONFIG_NXFFS_MAXNAMLEN: The maximum size of an NXFFS file name.
#   Default: 255.
# CONFIG_NXFFS_PACKTHRESHOLD: When packing flash file data,
#   don't both with file chunks smaller than this number of data bytes.
#   Default: 32.
# CONFIG_NXFFS_TAILTHRESHOLD: clean-up can either mean
#   packing files together toward the end of the file or, if file are
#   deleted at the end of the file, clean up can simply mean erasing

#  CONFIG_EXAMPLES_FTPD_NONETINIT - Define to suppress configuration of the
#    network by apps/examples/ftpd.  You would need to suppress network
#    configuration if the network is configuration prior to running the
#    example.
#
# NSH always initializes the network so if CONFIG_NSH_BUILTIN_APPS is
# defined, so is CONFIG_EXAMPLES_FTPD_NONETINIT (se it does not explicitly
# need to be defined in that case):
#
#  CONFIG_NSH_BUILTIN_APPS - Build the FTPD daemon example test as an
#    NSH built-in function.  By default the FTPD daemon will be built
#    as a standalone application.
#
# If CONFIG_EXAMPLES_FTPD_NONETINIT is not defined, then the following may
# be specified to customized the network configuration:
#
#  CONFIG_EXAMPLE_FTPD_NOMAC - If the hardware has no MAC address of its
#    own, define this =y to provide a bogus address for testing.
#  CONFIG_EXAMPLE_FTPD_IPADDR - The target IP address.  Default 10.0.0.2
#  CONFIG_EXAMPLE_FTPD_DRIPADDR - The default router address. Default
#    10.0.0.1
#  CONFIG_EXAMPLE_FTPD_NETMASK - The network mask.  Default: 255.255.255.0

#
# Stack and heap information
#
# CONFIG_BOOT_RUNFROMFLASH - Some configurations support XIP
#   operation from FLASH but must copy initialized .data sections to RAM.
#   (should also be =n for the LPC43xx which always runs from flash)
# CONFIG_BOOT_COPYTORAM -  Some configurations boot in FLASH
#   but copy themselves entirely into RAM for better performance.
# CONFIG_CUSTOM_STACK - The up_ implementation will handle
#   all stack operations outside of the nuttx model.
# CONFIG_STACK_POINTER - The initial stack pointer (arm7tdmi only)
# CONFIG_IDLETHREAD_STACKSIZE - The size of the initial stack.
#  This is the thread that (1) performs the inital boot of the system up
#  to the point where user_start() is spawned, and (2) there after is the
#  IDLE thread that executes only when there is no other thread ready to
#  run.
# CONFIG_USERMAIN_STACKSIZE - The size of the stack to allocate
#  for the main user thread that begins at the user_start() entry point.
# CONFIG_PTHREAD_STACK_MIN - Minimum pthread stack size
# CONFIG_PTHREAD_STACK_DEFAULT - Default pthread stack size
# CONFIG_HEAP_BASE - The beginning of the heap
# CONFIG_HEAP_SIZE - The size of the heap
