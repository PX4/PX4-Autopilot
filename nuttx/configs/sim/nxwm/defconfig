# CONFIG_APPS_DIR - Identifies the relative path to the directory

# CONFIG_DEBUG - enables built-in debug options
# CONFIG_DEBUG_VERBOSE - enables verbose debug output
# CONFIG_DEBUG_SYMBOLS - build without optimization and with

#   debug symbols (needed for use with a debugger).
# CONFIG_HAVE_CXX - Enable support for C++
# CONFIG_HAVE_CXXINITIALIZE - The platform-specific logic includes support
#   for initialization of static C++ instances for this architecture
#   and for the selected toolchain (via up_cxxinitialize()).
# CONFIG_MM_REGIONS - If the architecture includes multiple
#   regions of memory to allocate from, this specifies the
#   number of memory regions that the memory manager must
#   handle and enables the API mm_addregion(start, end);
# CONFIG_ARCH_LOWPUTC - architecture supports low-level, boot
#   time console output
# CONFIG_MSEC_PER_TICK - The default system timer is 100Hz
#   or MSEC_PER_TICK=10.  This setting may be defined to
#   inform NuttX that the processor hardware is providing
#   system timer interrupts at some interrupt interval other
#   than 10 msec.
# CONFIG_RR_INTERVAL - The round robin timeslice will be set
#   this number of milliseconds;  Round robin scheduling can
#   be disabled by setting this value to zero.
# CONFIG_SCHED_INSTRUMENTATION - enables instrumentation in 
#   scheduler to monitor system performance
# CONFIG_TASK_NAME_SIZE - Spcifies that maximum size of a

#   instrumentation is selected.  Set to zero to disable.
# CONFIG_JULIAN_TIME - Enables Julian time conversions
# CONFIG_START_YEAR, CONFIG_START_MONTH, CONFIG_START_DAY -
#   Used to initialize the internal time logic.

# CONFIG_DEV_LOWCONSOLE - Use the simple, low-level serial console
#   driver (minimul support)
# CONFIG_MUTEX_TYPES: Set to enable support for recursive and
#   errorcheck mutexes. Enables pthread_mutexattr_settype().
# CONFIG_PRIORITY_INHERITANCE : Set to enable support for priority
#   inheritance on mutexes and semaphores. 
# CONFIG_SEM_PREALLOCHOLDERS: This setting is only used if priority
#   inheritance is enabled.  It defines the maximum number of
#   different threads (minus one) that can take counts on a
#   semaphore with priority inheritance support.  This may be 
#   set to zero if priority inheritance is disabled OR if you
#   are only using semaphores as mutexes (only one holder) OR
#   if no more than two threads participate using a counting
#   semaphore.
# CONFIG_SEM_NNESTPRIO.  If priority inheritance is enabled,
#   then this setting is the maximum number of higher priority
#   threads (minus 1) than can be waiting for another thread
#   to release a count on a semaphore.  This value may be set
#   to zero if no more than one thread is expected to wait for
#   a semaphore.
# CONFIG_FDCLONE_DISABLE. Disable cloning of all file descriptors
#   by task_create() when a new task is started.  If set, all
#   files/drivers will appear to be closed in the new task.
# CONFIG_FDCLONE_STDIO. Disable cloning of all but the first
#   three file descriptors (stdin, stdout, stderr) by task_create()
#   when a new task is started. If set, all files/drivers will
#   appear to be closed in the new task except for stdin, stdout,
#   and stderr.
# CONFIG_SDCLONE_DISABLE. Disable cloning of all socket
#   desciptors by task_create() when a new task is started. If
#   set, all sockets will appear to be closed in the new task.
# CONFIG_SCHED_WORKQUEUE.  Create a dedicated "worker" thread to
#  handle delayed processing from interrupt handlers.  This feature
#  is required for some drivers but, if there are not complaints,
#  can be safely disabled.  The worker thread also performs
#  garbage collection -- completing any delayed memory deallocations
#  from interrupt handlers.  If the worker thread is disabled,
#  then that clean will be performed by the IDLE thread instead
#  (which runs at the lowest of priority and may not be appropriate
#  if memory reclamation is of high priority).  If CONFIG_SCHED_WORKQUEUE
#  is enabled, then the following options can also be used:
# CONFIG_SCHED_WORKPRIORITY - The execution priority of the worker
#  thread.  Default: 50
# CONFIG_SCHED_WORKPERIOD - How often the worker thread checks for
#  work in units of microseconds.  Default: 50*1000 (50 MS).
# CONFIG_SCHED_WORKSTACKSIZE - The stack size allocated for the worker
#  thread.  Default: CONFIG_IDLETHREAD_STACKSIZE.
# CONFIG_SIG_SIGWORK - The signal number that will be used to wake-up
#  the worker thread.  Default: 4
# CONFIG_SCHED_WAITPID - Enable the waitpid() API
# CONFIG_SCHED_ATEXIT - Enabled the atexit() API

#   to force automatic, line-oriented flushing the output buffer
#   for putc(), fputc(), putchar(), puts(), fputs(), printf(),

# Filesystem configuration
#
# CONFIG_FS_FAT - Enable FAT filesystem support
# CONFIG_FAT_SECTORSIZE - Max supported sector size
# CONFIG_FAT_LCNAMES - Enable use of the NT-style upper/lower case 8.3
#   file name support.
# CONFIG_FAT_LFN - Enable FAT long file names.  NOTE:  Microsoft claims
#   patents on FAT long file name technology.  Please read the
#   disclaimer in the top-level COPYING file and only enable this
#   feature if you understand these issues.
# CONFIG_FAT_MAXFNAME - If CONFIG_FAT_LFN is defined, then the
#   default, maximum long file name is 255 bytes.  This can eat up
#   a lot of memory (especially stack space).  If you are willing
#   to live with some non-standard, short long file names, then
#   define this value.  A good choice would be the same value as
#   selected for CONFIG_NAME_MAX which will limit the visibility
#   of longer file names anyway.
# CONFIG_FS_NXFFS: Enable NuttX FLASH file system (NXFF) support.
# CONFIG_NXFFS_ERASEDSTATE: The erased state of FLASH. 
#   This must have one of the values of 0xff or 0x00.
#   Default: 0xff.
# CONFIG_NXFFS_PACKTHRESHOLD: When packing flash file data,
#   don't both with file chunks smaller than this number of data bytes.
# CONFIG_NXFFS_MAXNAMLEN: The maximum size of an NXFFS file name.
#   Default: 255.
# CONFIG_NXFFS_PACKTHRESHOLD: When packing flash file data,
#   don't both with file chunks smaller than this number of data bytes.
#   Default: 32.
# CONFIG_NXFFS_TAILTHRESHOLD: clean-up can either mean
#   packing files together toward the end of the file or, if file are
#   deleted at the end of the file, clean up can simply mean erasing
#   the end of FLASH memory so that it can be re-used again.  However,
#   doing this can also harm the life of the FLASH part because it can
#   mean that the tail end of the FLASH is re-used too often. This
#   threshold determines if/when it is worth erased the tail end of FLASH
#   and making it available for re-use (and possible over-wear).
#   Default: 8192.
# CONFIG_FS_ROMFS - Enable ROMFS filesystem support
# CONFIG_FS_RAMMAP - For file systems that do not support XIP, this
#   option will enable a limited form of memory mapping that is
#   implemented by copying whole files into memory.

# NxConsole Configuration Settings:
#
# CONFIG_NXCONSOLE
#   Enables building of the NxConsole driver.
# CONFIG_NXCONSOLE_BPP
#   Currently, NxConsole supports only a single pixel depth. This
#   configuration setting must be provided to support that single pixel depth.
#   Default: The smallest enabled pixel depth. (see CONFIG_NX_DISABLE_*BPP)
# CONFIG_NXCONSOLE_MXCHARS
#   NxConsole needs to remember every character written to the console so
#   that it can redraw the window. This setting determines the size of some
#   internal memory allocations used to hold the character data. Default: 128.
# CONFIG_NXCONSOLE_CACHESIZE
#   NxConsole supports caching of rendered fonts. This font caching is required
#   for two reasons: (1) First, it improves text performance, but more
#   importantly (2) it preserves the font memory. Since the NX server runs on
#   a separate server thread, it requires that the rendered font memory persist
#   until the server has a chance to render the font. (NOTE: There is still
#   inherently a race condition in this!). Unfortunately, the font cache would
#   be quite large if all fonts were saved. The CONFIG_NXCONSOLE_CACHESIZE setting
#   will control the size of the font cache (in number of glyphs). Only that
