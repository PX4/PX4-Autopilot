# architecture selection
#
# CONFIG_ARCH - identifies the arch subdirectory and, hence, the
#   processor architecture.
# CONFIG_ARCH_family - for use in C code.  This identifies the
#   particular chip family that the architecture is implemented
#   in.
# CONFIG_ARCH_architecture - for use in C code.  This identifies the
#   specific architecture within the chip familyl.
# CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP - Identifies the arch/*/chip subdirectory
# CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP_name - For use in C code
# CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD - identifies the configs subdirectory and, hence,
#   the board that supports the particular chip or SoC.

# CONFIG_DRAM_START - The start address of DRAM (physical)
# CONFIG_DRAM_END - Last address+1 of installed RAM
# CONFIG_ARCH_IRQPRIO - The STM3240xxx supports interrupt prioritization
# CONFIG_ARCH_FPU - The STM3240xxx supports a floating point unit (FPU)
#   (But, unfortunately, GCC does not support it).
# CONFIG_ARCH_INTERRUPTSTACK - This architecture supports an interrupt
#   stack. If defined, this symbol is the size of the interrupt
#   stack in bytes.  If not defined, the user task stacks will be
#   used during interrupt handling.
# CONFIG_ARCH_STACKDUMP - Do stack dumps after assertions

#   serves no purpose other than it allows you to calibrate
# CONFIG_BOARD_LOOPSPERMSEC.  You simply use a stop watch to measure
#   the 100 second delay then adjust CONFIG_BOARD_LOOPSPERMSEC until
#   the delay actually is 100 seconds.

#   system timer interrupts at some interrupt interval other
#   than 10 msec.

#   this number of milliseconds;  Round robin scheduling can
#   be disabled by setting this value to zero.
# CONFIG_SCHED_INSTRUMENTATION - enables instrumentation in 
#   scheduler to monitor system performance
# CONFIG_TASK_NAME_SIZE - Spcifies that maximum size of a
#   task name to save in the TCB.  Useful if scheduler

#   provides /dev/console.  Enables stdout, stderr, stdin.
# CONFIG_DEV_LOWCONSOLE - Use the simple, low-level serial console
#   driver (minimul support)
# CONFIG_MUTEX_TYPES: Set to enable support for recursive and
#   errorcheck mutexes. Enables pthread_mutexattr_settype().
# CONFIG_PRIORITY_INHERITANCE : Set to enable support for priority
#   inheritance on mutexes and semaphores. 
# CONFIG_SEM_PREALLOCHOLDERS: This setting is only used if priority
#   inheritance is enabled.  It defines the maximum number of
#   different threads (minus one) that can take counts on a
#   semaphore with priority inheritance support.  This may be 
#   set to zero if priority inheritance is disabled OR if you
#   are only using semaphores as mutexes (only one holder) OR
#   if no more than two threads participate using a counting
#   semaphore.
# CONFIG_SEM_NNESTPRIO.  If priority inheritance is enabled,
#   then this setting is the maximum number of higher priority
#   threads (minus 1) than can be waiting for another thread

#   files/drivers will appear to be closed in the new task.
# CONFIG_FDCLONE_STDIO. Disable cloning of all but the first
#   three file descriptors (stdin, stdout, stderr) by task_create()
#   when a new task is started. If set, all files/drivers will
#   appear to be closed in the new task except for stdin, stdout,
#   and stderr.
# CONFIG_SDCLONE_DISABLE. Disable cloning of all socket
#   desciptors by task_create() when a new task is started. If
#   set, all sockets will appear to be closed in the new task.
# CONFIG_SCHED_WORKQUEUE.  Create a dedicated "worker" thread to
#  handle delayed processing from interrupt handlers.  This feature
#  is required for some drivers but, if there are not complaints,
#  can be safely disabled.  The worker thread also performs
#  garbage collection -- completing any delayed memory deallocations
#  from interrupt handlers.  If the worker thread is disabled,
#  then that clean will be performed by the IDLE thread instead
#  (which runs at the lowest of priority and may not be appropriate
#  if memory reclamation is of high priority).  If CONFIG_SCHED_WORKQUEUE
#  is enabled, then the following options can also be used:
# CONFIG_SCHED_WORKPRIORITY - The execution priority of the worker
#  thread.  Default: 50
# CONFIG_SCHED_WORKPERIOD - How often the worker thread checks for
#  work in units of microseconds.  Default: 50*1000 (50 MS).

# CONFIG_FAT_MAXFNAME - If CONFIG_FAT_LFN is defined, then the

#   a lot of memory (especially stack space).  If you are willing
#   to live with some non-standard, short long file names, then

#   the end of FLASH memory so that it can be re-used again.  However,
#   doing this can also harm the life of the FLASH part because it can
#   mean that the tail end of the FLASH is re-used too often. This

#    A full date / time RTC the provides the date and time information, often
#   in BCD format.  If CONFIG_RTC_DATETIME is selected, it specifies this
#   second kind of RTC. In this case, the RTC is used to "seed" the normal
#   NuttX timer and the NuttX system timer provides for higher resoution
#   time.
# CONFIG_RTC_HIRES - If CONFIG_RTC_DATETIME not selected, then the simple,
#   battery backed counter is used.  There are two different implementations
#   of such simple counters based on the time resolution of the counter:
#   The typical RTC keeps time to resolution of 1 second, usually
#   supporting a 32-bit time_t value.  In this case, the RTC is used to
#   "seed" the normal NuttX timer and the NuttX timer provides for higher
#   resoution time. If CONFIG_RTC_HIRES is enabled in the NuttX configuration,
#   then the RTC provides higher resolution time and completely replaces the
#   system timer for purpose of date and time.
# CONFIG_RTC_FREQUENCY - If CONFIG_RTC_HIRES is defined, then the frequency
#  of the high resolution RTC must be provided.  If CONFIG_RTC_HIRES is
#   not defined, CONFIG_RTC_FREQUENCY is assumed to be one.
# CONFIG_RTC_ALARM - Enable if the RTC hardware supports setting of an

# NxConsole Configuration Settings:
#
# CONFIG_NXCONSOLE
#   Enables building of the NxConsole driver.
# CONFIG_NXCONSOLE_BPP
#   Currently, NxConsole supports only a single pixel depth. This
#   configuration setting must be provided to support that single pixel depth.
#   Default: The smallest enabled pixel depth. (see CONFIG_NX_DISABLE_*BPP)
# CONFIG_NXCONSOLE_MXCHARS
#   NxConsole needs to remember every character written to the console so
#   that it can redraw the window. This setting determines the size of some
#   internal memory allocations used to hold the character data. Default: 128.
# CONFIG_NXCONSOLE_CACHESIZE
#   NxConsole supports caching of rendered fonts. This font caching is required
#   for two reasons: (1) First, it improves text performance, but more
#   importantly (2) it preserves the font memory. Since the NX server runs on
#   a separate server thread, it requires that the rendered font memory persist
#   until the server has a chance to render the font. (NOTE: There is still
#   inherently a race condition in this!). Unfortunately, the font cache would
#   be quite large if all fonts were saved. The CONFIG_NXCONSOLE_CACHESIZE setting
#   will control the size of the font cache (in number of glyphs). Only that
#   number of the most recently used glyphs will be retained. Default: 16.
# CONFIG_NXCONSOLE_LINESEPARATION
#   This the space (in rows) between each row of test.  Default: 2
# CONFIG_NXCONSOLE_NOWRAP
#   By default, lines will wrap when the test reaches the right hand side
#   of the window. This setting can be defining to change this behavior so
#   that the text is simply truncated until a new line is  encountered.

#  CONFIG_STM32_WWDG=y, OR
#  CONFIG_STM32_IWDG=y (but not both)
#
# Specific configuration options for this example include:
#
# CONFIG_EXAMPLES_WATCHDOG_DEVPATH - The path to the Watchdog device.
#   Default: /dev/watchdog0
# CONFIG_EXAMPLES_WATCHDOG_PINGTIME - Time in milliseconds that the example
#   will ping the watchdog before letting the watchdog expire. Default: 5000
#   milliseconds
# CONFIG_EXAMPLES_WATCHDOG_PINGDELAY - Time delay between pings in
#   milliseconds. Default: 500 milliseconds.
# CONFIG_EXAMPLES_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT - The watchdog timeout value in
#   milliseconds before the watchdog timer expires.  Default:  2000
#   milliseconds.
#
# CONFIG_EXAMPLES_WATCHDOG_DEVPATH
# CONFIG_EXAMPLES_WATCHDOG_PINGTIME
# CONFIG_EXAMPLES_WATCHDOG_PINGDELAY
# CONFIG_EXAMPLES_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT

#
# Settings for examples/pwm
#
# CONFIG_PWM - Enables PWM support.
# CONFIG_NSH_BUILTIN_APPS - Build the PWM test as an NSH built-in function.
#   Default: Not built!  The example can only be used as an NSH built-in
#   application
#
# CONFIG_EXAMPLES_PWM_DEVPATH - The path to the PWM device. Default: /dev/pwm0
# CONFIG_EXAMPLES_PWM_FREQUENCY - The initial PWM frequency.  Default: 100 Hz
# CONFIG_EXAMPLES_PWM_DUTYPCT - The initial PWM duty as a percentage.  Default: 50%
# CONFIG_EXAMPLES_PWM_DURATION - The initial PWM pulse train duration in sectonds.
#    as a percentage.  Default: 5 seconds

#
# Settings for examples/ftpd
#
#  CONFIG_EXAMPLES_FTPD_PRIO - Priority of the FTP daemon.
#    Default: SCHED_PRIORITY_DEFAULT
#  CONFIG_EXAMPLES_FTPD_STACKSIZE - Stack size allocated for the
#    FTP daemon. Default: 2048
#  CONFIG_EXAMPLES_FTPD_NONETINIT - Define to suppress configuration of the
#    network by apps/examples/ftpd.  You would need to suppress network
#    configuration if the network is configuration prior to running the
#    example.
#
# NSH always initializes the network so if CONFIG_NSH_BUILTIN_APPS is
# defined, so is CONFIG_EXAMPLES_FTPD_NONETINIT (se it does not explicitly
# need to be defined in that case):
#
#  CONFIG_NSH_BUILTIN_APPS - Build the FTPD daemon example test as an
#    NSH built-in function.  By default the FTPD daemon will be built
#    as a standalone application.
#
# If CONFIG_EXAMPLES_FTPD_NONETINIT is not defined, then the following may
# be specified to customized the network configuration:
#
#  CONFIG_EXAMPLE_FTPD_NOMAC - If the hardware has no MAC address of its
#    own, define this =y to provide a bogus address for testing.
#  CONFIG_EXAMPLE_FTPD_IPADDR - The target IP address.  Default 10.0.0.2
#  CONFIG_EXAMPLE_FTPD_DRIPADDR - The default router address. Default
#    10.0.0.1
#  CONFIG_EXAMPLE_FTPD_NETMASK - The network mask.  Default: 255.255.255.0

#
# Stack and heap information
#
# CONFIG_BOOT_RUNFROMFLASH - Some configurations support XIP
#   operation from FLASH but must copy initialized .data sections to RAM.
#   (should also be =n for the STM3240G-EVAL which always runs from flash)
# CONFIG_BOOT_COPYTORAM -  Some configurations boot in FLASH
#   but copy themselves entirely into RAM for better performance.
# CONFIG_CUSTOM_STACK - The up_ implementation will handle
#   all stack operations outside of the nuttx model.
# CONFIG_STACK_POINTER - The initial stack pointer (arm7tdmi only)
# CONFIG_IDLETHREAD_STACKSIZE - The size of the initial stack.
#  This is the thread that (1) performs the inital boot of the system up
#  to the point where user_start() is spawned, and (2) there after is the
#  IDLE thread that executes only when there is no other thread ready to
#  run.
# CONFIG_USERMAIN_STACKSIZE - The size of the stack to allocate
#  for the main user thread that begins at the user_start() entry point.
# CONFIG_PTHREAD_STACK_MIN - Minimum pthread stack size
# CONFIG_PTHREAD_STACK_DEFAULT - Default pthread stack size
# CONFIG_HEAP_BASE - The beginning of the heap
# CONFIG_HEAP_SIZE - The size of the heap
#
