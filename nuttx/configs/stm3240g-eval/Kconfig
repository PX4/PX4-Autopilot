if ARCH_BOARD_STM3240G_EVAL
config ARCH_LEDS
	bool "NuttX LED support"
	default n
	---help---
		"Support control of board LEDs by NuttX to indicate system state"

config ARCH_BUTTONS
	bool "Button support"
	default n
	---help---
		"Support interfaces to use buttons provided by the board."

config ARCH_IRQBUTTONS
	bool "Button interrupt support"
	default n
	depends on ARCH_BUTTONS
	---help---
		"Support EXTI interrupts on button presses and releases."

config STM3240G_LCD
	bool "Select support for the STM3210E-EVAL LCD"
	default y
	depends on LCD && STM32_FSMC
	---help---
		Enable support for the LCD on the STM3240G-EVAL board.  See additional,
		LCD-common settings in the drivers/lcd Kconfig file.

config LCD_RDSHIFT
	int "LCD data shift"
	default 5
	depends on STM3240G_LCD
	---help---
		When reading 16-bit gram data, there appears to be a shift in the returned
		data.  This value fixes the offset.  Default 5.

config CONFIG_STM32_ILI9320_DISABLE
	bool "Disable LCD_ILI9320 (and LCD_ILI9321) support"
	default n
	depends on STM3240G_LCD
	---help---
		The LCD driver dynamically selects the LCD based on the reported LCD
		ID value.  However, code size can be reduced by suppressing support for
		individual LCDs using this option.

config CONFIG_STM32_ILI9325_DISABLE
	bool "Disable LCD_ILI9325 support"
	default n
	depends on STM3240G_LCD
	---help---
		The LCD driver dynamically selects the LCD based on the reported LCD
		ID value.  However, code size can be reduced by suppressing support for
		individual LCDs using this option
