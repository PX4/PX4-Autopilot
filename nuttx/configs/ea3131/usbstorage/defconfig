# architecture selection
#
# CONFIG_ARCH - identifies the arch subdirectory and, hence, the
#   processor architecture.
# CONFIG_ARCH_family - for use in C code.  This identifies the
#   particular chip family that the architecture is implemented
#   in.
# CONFIG_ARCH_architecture - for use in C code.  This identifies the
#   specific architecture within the chip familyl.
# CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP - Identifies the arch/*/chip subdirectory
# CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP_name - For use in C code
# CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD - identifies the configs subdirectory and, hence,
#   the board that supports the particular chip or SoC.
# CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD_name - for use in C code
# CONFIG_ENDIAN_BIG - define if big endian (default is little endian)
# CONFIG_BOARD_LOOPSPERMSEC - for delay loops
# CONFIG_DRAM_SIZE - For most ARM9 architectures, this describes the
#   size of installed DRAM.  For the LPC31XX, it is used only to
#   deterimine how to map the executable regions.  It is SDRAM size
#   only if you are executing out of the external SDRAM; or it could
#   be NOR FLASH size, external SRAM size, or internal SRAM size.
# CONFIG_DRAM_START - The start address of DRAM (physical)
# CONFIG_DRAM_VSTART - The startaddress of DRAM (virtual)
# CONFIG_ARCH_IRQPRIO - The LPC31xx supports interrupt prioritization
# CONFIG_ARCH_INTERRUPTSTACK - This architecture supports an interrupt
#   stack. If defined, this symbol is the size of the interrupt
#   stack in bytes.  If not defined, the user task stacks will be
#   used during interrupt handling.
# CONFIG_ARCH_STACKDUMP - Do stack dumps after assertions
# CONFIG_ARCH_BOOTLOADER - Set if you are using a bootloader.
# CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS -  Use LEDs to show state. Unique to board architecture.
# CONFIG_ARCH_BUTTONS -  Enable support for buttons. Unique to board architecture.
# CONFIG_ARCH_CALIBRATION - Enables some build in instrumentation that
#   cause a 100 second delay during boot-up.  This 100 second delay
#   serves no purpose other than it allows you to calibrate
#   CONFIG_BOARD_LOOPSPERMSEC.  You simply use a stop watch to measure
#   the 100 second delay then adjust CONFIG_BOARD_LOOPSPERMSEC until
#   the delay actually is 100 seconds.
# CONFIG_ARCH_DMA - Support DMA initialization

# CONFIG_APPS_DIR - Identifies the relative path to the directory

# CONFIG_DEBUG - enables built-in debug options
# CONFIG_DEBUG_VERBOSE - enables verbose debug output
# CONFIG_DEBUG_SYMBOLS - build without optimization and with
#   debug symbols (needed for use with a debugger).
# CONFIG_MM_REGIONS - If the architecture includes multiple
#   regions of memory to allocate from, this specifies the
#   number of memory regions that the memory manager must
#   handle and enables the API mm_addregion(start, end);
# CONFIG_ARCH_LOWPUTC - architecture supports low-level, boot
#   time console output
# CONFIG_MSEC_PER_TICK - The default system timer is 100Hz
#   or MSEC_PER_TICK=10.  This setting may be defined to
#   inform NuttX that the processor hardware is providing
#   system timer interrupts at some interrupt interval other
#   than 10 msec.
# CONFIG_RR_INTERVAL - The round robin timeslice will be set
#   this number of milliseconds;  Round robin scheduling can
#   be disabled by setting this value to zero.
# CONFIG_SCHED_INSTRUMENTATION - enables instrumentation in 
#   scheduler to monitor system performance
# CONFIG_TASK_NAME_SIZE - Spcifies that maximum size of a
#   task name to save in the TCB.  Useful if scheduler
#   instrumentation is selected.  Set to zero to disable.
# CONFIG_START_YEAR, CONFIG_START_MONTH, CONFIG_START_DAY -
#   Used to initialize the internal time logic.
# CONFIG_GREGORIAN_TIME - Enables Gregorian time conversions.
#   You would only need this if you are concerned about accurate
#   time conversions in the past or in the distant future.
# CONFIG_JULIAN_TIME - Enables Julian time conversions. You
#   would only need this if you are concerned about accurate
#   time conversion in the distand past.  You must also define
#   CONFIG_GREGORIAN_TIME in order to use Julian time.
# CONFIG_DEV_CONSOLE - Set if architecture-specific logic
#   provides /dev/console.  Enables stdout, stderr, stdin.
# CONFIG_DEV_LOWCONSOLE - Use the simple, low-level serial console
#   driver (minimul support)
# CONFIG_MUTEX_TYPES: Set to enable support for recursive and
#   errorcheck mutexes. Enables pthread_mutexattr_settype().
# CONFIG_PRIORITY_INHERITANCE : Set to enable support for priority
#   inheritance on mutexes and semaphores. 
# CONFIG_SEM_PREALLOCHOLDERS: This setting is only used if priority
#   inheritance is enabled.  It defines the maximum number of
#   different threads (minus one) that can take counts on a
#   semaphore with priority inheritance support.  This may be 
#   set to zero if priority inheritance is disabled OR if you
#   are only using semaphores as mutexes (only one holder) OR
#   if no more than two threads participate using a counting
#   semaphore.
# CONFIG_SEM_NNESTPRIO.  If priority inheritance is enabled,
#   then this setting is the maximum number of higher priority
#   threads (minus 1) than can be waiting for another thread
#   to release a count on a semaphore.  This value may be set
#   to zero if no more than one thread is expected to wait for
#   a semaphore.
# CONFIG_FDCLONE_DISABLE. Disable cloning of all file descriptors
#   by task_create() when a new task is started.  If set, all
#   files/drivers will appear to be closed in the new task.
# CONFIG_FDCLONE_STDIO. Disable cloning of all but the first
#   three file descriptors (stdin, stdout, stderr) by task_create()
#   when a new task is started. If set, all files/drivers will
#   appear to be closed in the new task except for stdin, stdout,
#   and stderr.
# CONFIG_SDCLONE_DISABLE. Disable cloning of all socket
#   desciptors by task_create() when a new task is started. If
#   set, all sockets will appear to be closed in the new task.
# CONFIG_NXFLAT. Enable support for the NXFLAT binary format.
#  This format will support execution of NuttX binaries located
#  in a ROMFS filesystem (see examples/nxflat).
# CONFIG_SCHED_WORKQUEUE.  Create a dedicated "worker" thread to
#  handle delayed processing from interrupt handlers.  This feature
#  is required for some drivers but, if there are not complaints,
#  can be safely disabled.  The worker thread also performs
#  garbage collection -- completing any delayed memory deallocations
#  from interrupt handlers.  If the worker thread is disabled,
#  then that clean will be performed by the IDLE thread instead
#  (which runs at the lowest of priority and may not be appropriate
#  if memory reclamation is of high priority).  If CONFIG_SCHED_WORKQUEUE
#  is enabled, then the following options can also be used:
# CONFIG_SCHED_WORKPRIORITY - The execution priority of the worker
#  thread.  Default: 50
# CONFIG_SCHED_WORKPERIOD - How often the worker thread checks for
#  work in units of microseconds.  Default: 50000 (50 MS).
# CONFIG_SCHED_WORKSTACKSIZE - The stack size allocated for the worker
#  thread.  Default: CONFIG_IDLETHREAD_STACKSIZE.
# CONFIG_SIG_SIGWORK - The signal number that will be used to wake-up
#  the worker thread.  Default: 4

# CONFIG_EXAMPLES_USBMSC_NLUNS
#    Defines the number of logical units (LUNs) exported by the USB storage
#    driver.  Each LUN corresponds to one exported block driver (or partition
#    of a block driver).  May be 1, 2, or 3.  Default is 1.
# CONFIG_EXAMPLES_USBMSC_DEVMINOR1
#    The minor device number of the block driver for the first LUN. For
#    example, N in /dev/mmcsdN.  Used for registering the block driver. Default
#    is zero.
# CONFIG_EXAMPLES_USBMSC_DEVPATH1
#    The full path to the registered block driver.  Default is "/dev/mmcsd0"
#  CONFIG_EXAMPLES_USBMSC_DEVMINOR2 and CONFIG_EXAMPLES_USBMSC_DEVPATH2
#    Similar parameters that would have to be provided if CONFIG_EXAMPLES_USBMSC_NLUNS
#    is 2 or 3.  No defaults.
#  CONFIG_EXAMPLES_USBMSC_DEVMINOR3 and CONFIG_EXAMPLES_USBMSC_DEVPATH3

#
#  If CONFIG_USBDEV_TRACE is enabled (or CONFIG_DEBUG and CONFIG_DEBUG_USB), then
#  the example code will also manage the USB trace output.  The amount of trace output
#  can be controlled using:
#

#    Show initialization events
#  CONFIG_EXAMPLES_USBMSC_TRACECLASS
#    Show class driver events
#  CONFIG_EXAMPLES_USBMSC_TRACETRANSFERS

#  CONFIG_EXAMPLES_USBMSC_TRACECONTROLLER

# CONFIG_CUSTOM_STACK - The up_ implementation will handle

# CONFIG_STACK_POINTER - The initial stack pointer (arm7tdmi only)
# CONFIG_IDLETHREAD_STACKSIZE - The size of the initial stack.
#  This is the thread that (1) performs the inital boot of the system up
#  to the point where user_start() is spawned, and (2) there after is the
#  IDLE thread that executes only when there is no other thread ready to

# CONFIG_PTHREAD_STACK_MIN - Minimum pthread stack size
# CONFIG_PTHREAD_STACK_DEFAULT - Default pthread stack size
# CONFIG_HEAP_BASE - The beginning of the heap
