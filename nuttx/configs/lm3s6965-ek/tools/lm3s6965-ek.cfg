	# When nRST is asserted on most Stellaris devices, it clears some of
	# the debug state.  The ARMv7M and Cortex-M3 TRMs say that's wrong;
	# and OpenOCD depends on those TRMs.  So we won't use SRST on those
	# chips.  (Only power-on reset should affect debug state, beyond a
	# few specified bits; not the chip's nRST input, wired to SRST.)
