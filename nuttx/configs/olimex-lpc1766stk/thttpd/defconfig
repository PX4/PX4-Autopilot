# architecture selection
#
# CONFIG_ARCH - identifies the arch subdirectory and, hence, the
#   processor architecture.
# CONFIG_ARCH_family - for use in C code.  This identifies the
#   particular chip family that the architecture is implemented
#   in.
# CONFIG_ARCH_architecture - for use in C code.  This identifies the
#   specific architecture within the chip familyl.
# CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP - Identifies the arch/*/chip subdirectory

#   the board that supports the particular chip or SoC.
# CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD_name - for use in C code
# CONFIG_ENDIAN_BIG - define if big endian (default is little endian)
# CONFIG_BOARD_LOOPSPERMSEC - for delay loops
# CONFIG_DRAM_SIZE - Describes the installed DRAM.
# CONFIG_DRAM_START - The start address of DRAM (physical)
# CONFIG_DRAM_END - Last address+1 of installed RAM
# CONFIG_ARCH_IRQPRIO - The LPC17xx supports interrupt prioritization
# CONFIG_ARCH_INTERRUPTSTACK - This architecture supports an interrupt
#   stack. If defined, this symbol is the size of the interrupt
#   stack in bytes.  If not defined, the user task stacks will be
#   used during interrupt handling.

# CONFIG_ARCH_LOWPUTC - architecture supports low-level, boot
#   time console output
# CONFIG_MSEC_PER_TICK - The default system timer is 100Hz
#   or MSEC_PER_TICK=10.  This setting may be defined to
#   inform NuttX that the processor hardware is providing
#   system timer interrupts at some interrupt interval other
#   than 10 msec.
# CONFIG_RR_INTERVAL - The round robin timeslice will be set
#   this number of milliseconds;  Round robin scheduling can
#   be disabled by setting this value to zero.
# CONFIG_SCHED_INSTRUMENTATION - enables instrumentation in 
#   scheduler to monitor system performance
# CONFIG_TASK_NAME_SIZE - Spcifies that maximum size of a
#   task name to save in the TCB.  Useful if scheduler

# CONFIG_GREGORIAN_TIME - Enables Gregorian time conversions.
#   You would only need this if you are concerned about accurate
#   time conversions in the past or in the distant future.
# CONFIG_JULIAN_TIME - Enables Julian time conversions. You
#   would only need this if you are concerned about accurate
#   time conversion in the distand past.  You must also define

# CONFIG_DEV_CONSOLE - Set if architecture-specific logic
#   provides /dev/console.  Enables stdout, stderr, stdin.
# CONFIG_DEV_LOWCONSOLE - Use the simple, low-level serial console
#   driver (minimul support)
# CONFIG_MUTEX_TYPES: Set to enable support for recursive and
#   errorcheck mutexes. Enables pthread_mutexattr_settype().
# CONFIG_PRIORITY_INHERITANCE : Set to enable support for priority
#   inheritance on mutexes and semaphores. 
# CONFIG_SEM_PREALLOCHOLDERS: This setting is only used if priority
#   inheritance is enabled.  It defines the maximum number of
#   different threads (minus one) that can take counts on a
#   semaphore with priority inheritance support.  This may be 
#   set to zero if priority inheritance is disabled OR if you
#   are only using semaphores as mutexes (only one holder) OR
#   if no more than two threads participate using a counting
#   semaphore.
# CONFIG_SEM_NNESTPRIO.  If priority inheritance is enabled,
#   then this setting is the maximum number of higher priority
#   threads (minus 1) than can be waiting for another thread
#   to release a count on a semaphore.  This value may be set
#   to zero if no more than one thread is expected to wait for
#   a semaphore.
# CONFIG_FDCLONE_DISABLE. Disable cloning of all file descriptors
#   by task_create() when a new task is started.  If set, all
#   files/drivers will appear to be closed in the new task.
# CONFIG_FDCLONE_STDIO. Disable cloning of all but the first
#   three file descriptors (stdin, stdout, stderr) by task_create()
#   when a new task is started. If set, all files/drivers will
#   appear to be closed in the new task except for stdin, stdout,
#   and stderr.
# CONFIG_SDCLONE_DISABLE. Disable cloning of all socket
#   desciptors by task_create() when a new task is started. If
#   set, all sockets will appear to be closed in the new task.
# CONFIG_SCHED_WORKQUEUE.  Create a dedicated "worker" thread to
#  handle delayed processing from interrupt handlers.  This feature
#  is required for some drivers but, if there are not complaints,
#  can be safely disabled.  The worker thread also performs
#  garbage collection -- completing any delayed memory deallocations
#  from interrupt handlers.  If the worker thread is disabled,
#  then that clean will be performed by the IDLE thread instead
#  (which runs at the lowest of priority and may not be appropriate
#  if memory reclamation is of high priority).  If CONFIG_SCHED_WORKQUEUE
#  is enabled, then the following options can also be used:
# CONFIG_SCHED_WORKPRIORITY - The execution priority of the worker
#  thread.  Default: 50
# CONFIG_SCHED_WORKPERIOD - How often the worker thread checks for
#  work in units of microseconds.  Default: 50*1000 (50 MS).
# CONFIG_SCHED_WORKSTACKSIZE - The stack size allocated for the worker
#  thread.  Default: CONFIG_IDLETHREAD_STACKSIZE.
# CONFIG_SIG_SIGWORK - The signal number that will be used to wake-up
#  the worker thread.  Default: 4

# CONFIG_FS_FAT - Enable FAT filesystem support
# CONFIG_FAT_SECTORSIZE - Max supported sector size
# CONFIG_FAT_LCNAMES - Enable use of the NT-style upper/lower case 8.3
#   file name support.
# CONFIG_FAT_LFN - Enable FAT long file names.  NOTE:  Microsoft claims
#   patents on FAT long file name technology.  Please read the
#   disclaimer in the top-level COPYING file and only enable this
#   feature if you understand these issues.
# CONFIG_FAT_MAXFNAME - If CONFIG_FAT_LFN is defined, then the
#   default, maximum long file name is 255 bytes.  This can eat up
#   a lot of memory (especially stack space).  If you are willing
#   to live with some non-standard, short long file names, then
#   define this value.  A good choice would be the same value as
#   selected for CONFIG_NAME_MAX which will limit the visibility
#   of longer file names anyway.
# CONFIG_FS_NXFFS: Enable NuttX FLASH file system (NXFF) support.
# CONFIG_NXFFS_ERASEDSTATE: The erased state of FLASH. 
#   This must have one of the values of 0xff or 0x00.
#   Default: 0xff.
# CONFIG_NXFFS_PACKTHRESHOLD: When packing flash file data,
#   don't both with file chunks smaller than this number of data bytes.
# CONFIG_NXFFS_MAXNAMLEN: The maximum size of an NXFFS file name.

# CONFIG_NXFFS_PACKTHRESHOLD: When packing flash file data,
#   don't both with file chunks smaller than this number of data bytes.
#   Default: 32.
# CONFIG_NXFFS_TAILTHRESHOLD: clean-up can either mean
#   packing files together toward the end of the file or, if file are
#   deleted at the end of the file, clean up can simply mean erasing
#   the end of FLASH memory so that it can be re-used again.  However,
#   doing this can also harm the life of the FLASH part because it can
#   mean that the tail end of the FLASH is re-used too often. This
#   threshold determines if/when it is worth erased the tail end of FLASH
#   and making it available for re-use (and possible over-wear).
#   Default: 8192.
# CONFIG_FS_ROMFS - Enable ROMFS filesystem support

# THTTPD settings
#
# CONFIG_THTTPD_PORT - THTTPD Server port number
# CONFIG_THTTPD_IPADDR - Server IP address (no host name)
# CONFIG_THTTPD_SERVER_ADDRESS - SERVER_ADDRESS: response
# CONFIG_THTTPD_SERVER_SOFTWARE - SERVER_SOFTWARE: response
# CONFIG_THTTPD_PATH - Server working directory
# CONFIG_THTTPD_CGI_PATH - Path to CGI executables
# CONFIG_THTTPD_CGI_PATTERN - Only CGI programs matching this
#   pattern will be executed.  In fact, if this value is not defined
#   then no CGI logic will be built.
# CONFIG_THTTPD_CGI_PRIORITY - Provides the priority of CGI child tasks
# CONFIG_THTTPD_CGI_STACKSIZE - Provides the initial stack size of
#   CGI child task (will be overridden by the stack size in the NXFLAT
#   header)
# CONFIG_THTTPD_CGI_BYTECOUNT - Byte output limit for CGI tasks.
# CONFIG_THTTPD_CGI_TIMELIMIT - How many seconds to allow CGI programs
#   to run before killing them.
# CONFIG_THTTPD_CHARSET- The default character set name to use with
#   text MIME types.
# CONFIG_THTTPD_IOBUFFERSIZE - 
# CONFIG_THTTPD_INDEX_NAMES - A list of index filenames to check. The
#   files are searched for in this order.
# CONFIG_AUTH_FILE - The file to use for authentication. If this is
#   defined then thttpd checks for this file in the local directory
#   before every fetch. If the file exists then authentication is done,
#   otherwise the fetch proceeds as usual. If you leave this undefined
#   then thttpd will not implement authentication at all and will not
#   check for auth files, which saves a bit of CPU time. A typical
#   value is ".htpasswd"
# CONFIG_THTTPD_LISTEN_BACKLOG - The listen() backlog queue length.
# CONFIG_THTTPD_LINGER_MSEC - How many milliseconds to leave a connection
#   open while doing a lingering close.
# CONFIG_THTTPD_OCCASIONAL_MSEC - How often to run the occasional
#   cleanup job.
# CONFIG_THTTPD_IDLE_READ_LIMIT_SEC - How many seconds to allow for
#  reading the initial request on a new connection.
# CONFIG_THTTPD_IDLE_SEND_LIMIT_SEC - How many seconds before an
#   idle connection gets closed.
# CONFIG_THTTPD_TILDE_MAP1 and CONFIG_THTTPD_TILDE_MAP2 - Tilde mapping.
#   Many URLs use ~username to indicate a user's home directory. thttpd
#   provides two options for mapping this construct to an  actual filename.
#   1) Map ~username to <prefix>/username. This is the recommended choice.
#     Each user gets a subdirectory in the main web tree, and the tilde
#     construct points there. The prefix could be something like "users",
#     or it could be empty.
#   2) Map ~username to <user's homedir>/<postfix>. The postfix would be
#     the name of a subdirectory off of the user's actual home dir,
#     something like "public_html".
#   You can also leave both options undefined, and thttpd will not do
#   anything special about tildes. Enabling both options is an error.
#   Typical values, if they're defined, are "users" for
#   CONFIG_THTTPD_TILDE_MAP1 and "public_html"forCONFIG_THTTPD_TILDE_MAP2. 
# CONFIG_THTTPD_GENERATE_INDICES
# CONFIG_THTTPD_URLPATTERN - If defined, then it will be used to match
#   and verify referrers.
