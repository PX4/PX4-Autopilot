 * Button support.
 *
 * Description:
 *   up_buttoninit() must be called to initialize button resources.  After
 *   that, up_buttons() may be called to collect the current state of all
 *   buttons or up_irqbutton() may be called to register button interrupt
 *   handlers.
 *
 *   After up_buttoninit() has been called, up_buttons() may be called to
 *   collect the state of all buttons.  up_buttons() returns an 8-bit bit set
 *   with each bit associated with a button.  See the BUTTON_*_BIT and JOYSTICK_*_BIT
 *   definitions in board.h for the meaning of each bit.
 *
 *   up_irqbutton() may be called to register an interrupt handler that will
 *   be called when a button is depressed or released.  The ID value is a
 *   button enumeration value that uniquely identifies a button resource. See the
 *   BUTTON_* and JOYSTICK_* definitions in board.h for the meaning of enumeration
 *   value.  The previous interrupt handler address is returned (so that it may
 *   restored, if so desired).
