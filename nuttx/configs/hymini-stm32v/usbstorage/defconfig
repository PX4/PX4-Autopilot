# architecture selection
#
# CONFIG_ARCH - identifies the arch subdirectory and, hence, the
#   processor architecture.
# CONFIG_ARCH_family - for use in C code.  This identifies the
#   particular chip family that the architecture is implemented
#   in.
# CONFIG_ARCH_architecture - for use in C code.  This identifies the
#   specific architecture within the chip familyl.
# CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP - Identifies the arch/*/chip subdirectory
# CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP_name - For use in C code
# CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD - identifies the configs subdirectory and, hence,
#   the board that supports the particular chip or SoC.
# CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD_name - for use in C code
# CONFIG_ENDIAN_BIG - define if big endian (default is little endian)
# CONFIG_BOARD_LOOPSPERMSEC - for delay loops
# CONFIG_DRAM_SIZE - Describes the installed DRAM.
# CONFIG_DRAM_START - The start address of DRAM (physical)
# CONFIG_DRAM_END - Last address+1 of installed RAM
# CONFIG_ARCH_IRQPRIO - The ST32F103Z supports interrupt prioritization
# CONFIG_ARCH_INTERRUPTSTACK - This architecture supports an interrupt
#   stack. If defined, this symbol is the size of the interrupt
#   stack in bytes.  If not defined, the user task stacks will be
#   used during interrupt handling.
# CONFIG_ARCH_STACKDUMP - Do stack dumps after assertions
# CONFIG_ARCH_BOOTLOADER - Set if you are using a bootloader.
# CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS -  Use LEDs to show state. Unique to board architecture.

#   serves no purpose other than it allows you to calibrate
#   CONFIG_BOARD_LOOPSPERMSEC.  You simply use a stop watch to measure
#   the 100 second delay then adjust CONFIG_BOARD_LOOPSPERMSEC until

# CONFIG_DEBUG - enables built-in debug options
# CONFIG_DEBUG_VERBOSE - enables verbose debug output
# CONFIG_DEBUG_SYMBOLS - build without optimization and with
#   debug symbols (needed for use with a debugger).
# CONFIG_MM_REGIONS - If the architecture includes multiple
#   regions of memory to allocate from, this specifies the
#   number of memory regions that the memory manager must
#   handle and enables the API mm_addregion(start, end);
# CONFIG_ARCH_LOWPUTC - architecture supports low-level, boot
#   time console output
# CONFIG_MSEC_PER_TICK - The default system timer is 100Hz
#   or MSEC_PER_TICK=10.  This setting may be defined to
#   inform NuttX that the processor hardware is providing
#   system timer interrupts at some interrupt interval other
#   than 10 msec.
# CONFIG_RR_INTERVAL - The round robin timeslice will be set
#   this number of milliseconds;  Round robin scheduling can
#   be disabled by setting this value to zero.
# CONFIG_SCHED_INSTRUMENTATION - enables instrumentation in 
#   scheduler to monitor system performance
# CONFIG_TASK_NAME_SIZE - Spcifies that maximum size of a
#   task name to save in the TCB.  Useful if scheduler
#   instrumentation is selected.  Set to zero to disable.
# CONFIG_START_YEAR, CONFIG_START_MONTH, CONFIG_START_DAY -
#   Used to initialize the internal time logic.
# CONFIG_GREGORIAN_TIME - Enables Gregorian time conversions.
#   You would only need this if you are concerned about accurate
#   time conversions in the past or in the distant future.
# CONFIG_JULIAN_TIME - Enables Julian time conversions. You
#   would only need this if you are concerned about accurate
#   time conversion in the distand past.  You must also define
#   CONFIG_GREGORIAN_TIME in order to use Julian time.
# CONFIG_DEV_CONSOLE - Set if architecture-specific logic
#   provides /dev/console.  Enables stdout, stderr, stdin.
# CONFIG_DEV_LOWCONSOLE - Use the simple, low-level serial console
#   driver (minimul support)
# CONFIG_MUTEX_TYPES: Set to enable support for recursive and
#   errorcheck mutexes. Enables pthread_mutexattr_settype().
# CONFIG_PRIORITY_INHERITANCE : Set to enable support for priority
#   inheritance on mutexes and semaphores. 
# CONFIG_SEM_PREALLOCHOLDERS: This setting is only used if priority
#   inheritance is enabled.  It defines the maximum number of
#   different threads (minus one) that can take counts on a
#   semaphore with priority inheritance support.  This may be 
#   set to zero if priority inheritance is disabled OR if you
#   are only using semaphores as mutexes (only one holder) OR
#   if no more than two threads participate using a counting
#   semaphore.
# CONFIG_SEM_NNESTPRIO.  If priority inheritance is enabled,
#   then this setting is the maximum number of higher priority
#   threads (minus 1) than can be waiting for another thread
#   to release a count on a semaphore.  This value may be set
#   to zero if no more than one thread is expected to wait for
#   a semaphore.
# CONFIG_FDCLONE_DISABLE. Disable cloning of all file descriptors
#   by task_create() when a new task is started.  If set, all
#   files/drivers will appear to be closed in the new task.
# CONFIG_FDCLONE_STDIO. Disable cloning of all but the first
#   three file descriptors (stdin, stdout, stderr) by task_create()
#   when a new task is started. If set, all files/drivers will
#   appear to be closed in the new task except for stdin, stdout,
#   and stderr.
# CONFIG_SDCLONE_DISABLE. Disable cloning of all socket
#   desciptors by task_create() when a new task is started. If
#   set, all sockets will appear to be closed in the new task.
# CONFIG_SCHED_WORKQUEUE.  Create a dedicated "worker" thread to
#  handle delayed processing from interrupt handlers.  This feature
#  is required for some drivers but, if there are not complaints,
#  can be safely disabled.  The worker thread also performs
#  garbage collection -- completing any delayed memory deallocations
#  from interrupt handlers.  If the worker thread is disabled,
#  then that clean will be performed by the IDLE thread instead
#  (which runs at the lowest of priority and may not be appropriate
#  if memory reclamation is of high priority).  If CONFIG_SCHED_WORKQUEUE
#  is enabled, then the following options can also be used:
# CONFIG_SCHED_WORKPRIORITY - The execution priority of the worker
#  thread.  Default: 50
# CONFIG_SCHED_WORKPERIOD - How often the worker thread checks for
#  work in units of microseconds.  Default: 50*1000 (50 MS).
# CONFIG_SCHED_WORKSTACKSIZE - The stack size allocated for the worker
#  thread.  Default: CONFIG_IDLETHREAD_STACKSIZE.
# CONFIG_SIG_SIGWORK - The signal number that will be used to wake-up
#  the worker thread.  Default: 4

# CONFIG_FS_FAT - Enable FAT filesystem support
# CONFIG_FAT_SECTORSIZE - Max supported sector size
# CONFIG_FAT_LCNAMES - Enable use of the NT-style upper/lower case 8.3
#   file name support.
# CONFIG_FAT_LFN - Enable FAT long file names.  NOTE:  Microsoft claims
#   patents on FAT long file name technology.  Please read the
#   disclaimer in the top-level COPYING file and only enable this
#   feature if you understand these issues.
# CONFIG_FAT_MAXFNAME - If CONFIG_FAT_LFN is defined, then the
#   default, maximum long file name is 255 bytes.  This can eat up
#   a lot of memory (especially stack space).  If you are willing
#   to live with some non-standard, short long file names, then
#   define this value.  A good choice would be the same value as
#   selected for CONFIG_NAME_MAX which will limit the visibility
#   of longer file names anyway.
# CONFIG_FS_NXFFS: Enable NuttX FLASH file system (NXFF) support.
# CONFIG_NXFFS_ERASEDSTATE: The erased state of FLASH. 
#   This must have one of the values of 0xff or 0x00.

# CONFIG_NXFFS_PACKTHRESHOLD: When packing flash file data,
#   don't both with file chunks smaller than this number of data bytes.

# CONFIG_NXFFS_PACKTHRESHOLD: When packing flash file data,
#   don't both with file chunks smaller than this number of data bytes.
#   Default: 32.
# CONFIG_NXFFS_TAILTHRESHOLD: clean-up can either mean
#   packing files together toward the end of the file or, if file are
#   deleted at the end of the file, clean up can simply mean erasing
#   the end of FLASH memory so that it can be re-used again.  However,
#   doing this can also harm the life of the FLASH part because it can
#   mean that the tail end of the FLASH is re-used too often. This
#   threshold determines if/when it is worth erased the tail end of FLASH
#   and making it available for re-use (and possible over-wear).
#   Default: 8192.
# CONFIG_FS_ROMFS - Enable ROMFS filesystem support

# CONFIG_EXAMPLES_USBMSC_NLUNS
