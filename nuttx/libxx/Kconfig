comment "Basic CXX Support"

config C99_BOOL8
	bool "sizeof(_Bool) is 8-bits"
	default n
	---help---
		This setting means (1) your C++ compiler has sizeof(_Bool) == 8, (2)
		your C compiler supports the C99 _Bool intrinsic type, and (2) that
		the C99 _Bool type also has size 1.

config HAVE_CXX
	bool "Have C++ compiler"
	default n
	---help---
		Toolchain supports C++ and CXX, CXXFLAGS, and COMPILEXX have been 
		defined in the configurations Make.defs file.

if HAVE_CXX

config HAVE_CXXINITIALIZE
	bool "Have C++ initialization"
	default n
	---help---
		The platform-specific logic includes support for initialization
		of static C++ instances for this architecture and for the selected 
		toolchain (via up_cxxinitialize()).

config CXX_NEWLONG
	bool "size_t is type long"
	default n
	---help---
		size_t may be type long or type int.  This matters for some
		C++ library routines because the NuttX size_t might not have
		the same underlying type as your toolchain's size_t.

comment "uClibc++ Standard C++ Library"

config UCLIBCXX
	bool "Build uClibc++ (must be installed)"
	default n
	---help---
		If you have installed uClibc++ into the NuttX source try, then it can
		be built by selecting this option.  See misc/uClibc++/README.txt for
		information on installing uClibc++.

if UCLIBCXX

config UCLIBCXX_EXCEPTION
	bool "Enable Exception Suppport"
	default y

config UCLIBCXX_IOSTREAM_BUFSIZE
	int "IO Stream Buffer Size"
	default 32

config UCLIBCXX_HAVE_LIBSUPCXX
	bool "Have libsupc++ (required)"
	default y
	---help---
		Select if your toolchain provides libsupc++.  This option is required
		at present because the built-in libsupc++ support is incomplete.
