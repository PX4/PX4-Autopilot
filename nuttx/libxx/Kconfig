	bool "Have C++ initialization"
	default n
	---help---
		The platform-specific logic includes support for initialization
		of static C++ instances for this architecture and for the selected 
		toolchain (via up_cxxinitialize()).

config CXX_NEWLONG
	bool "size_t is type long"
	default n
	---help---
		size_t may be type long or type int.  This matters for some
		C++ library routines because the NuttX size_t might not have
		the same underlying type as your toolchain's size_t.

	bool "Build uClibc++ (must be installed)"
	default n
	---help---
		If you have installed uClibc++ into the NuttX source try, then it can
