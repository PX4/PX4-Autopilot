uint64 timestamp		# time since system start (microseconds)
uint32 device_id		# unique device ID for the sensor that does not change between power cycles
int16[16] channel_id		# ADC channel IDs, negative for non-existent, TODO: should be kept same as array index
int32[16] raw_data		# ADC channel raw value, accept negative value, valid if channel ID is positive
uint32 resolution		# ADC channel resolution
float32 v_ref			# ADC channel voltage reference, use to calculate LSB voltage(lsb=scale/resolution)
