# Balloons

<LinkedBadge type="warning" text="Experimental" url="../airframes/#experimental-vehicles"/>

:::warning
Support for balloons is [experimental](../airframes/index.md#experimental-vehicles).
Maintainer volunteers, [contribution](../contribute/index.md) of new features, new frame configurations, or other improvements would all be very welcome!
:::

PX4 supports a single balloon geometry with no flight controls.
The frame configuration is shown in [Airframes Reference > Balloon](../airframes/airframe_reference.md#balloon).
