uint16 signature

# When looking along the optical axis of the camera, x points right, y points down, and z points along the optical axis.
float32 pos_x # tan(theta), where theta is the angle between the target and the camera center of projection in camera x-axis
float32 pos_y # tan(theta), where theta is the angle between the target and the camera center of projection in camera y-axis
float32 size_x #/** size of target along camera x-axis in units of tan(theta) **/
float32 size_y #/** size of target along camera y-axis in units of tan(theta) **/
