# 비행 모드

Flight modes provide autopilot support to make it easier to manually fly the vehicle, to automate common tasks such as takeoff and landing, to execute autonomous missions, or to defer flight control to an external system.

For information about flight modes available to specific frames see the following topics:

- [Flight Modes (Multicopter)](../flight_modes_mc/index.md)
- [Flight Modes (Fixed-Wing)](../flight_modes_fw/index.md)
- [Flight Modes (VTOL)](../flight_modes_vtol/index.md)
- [Drive Modes (Differential Rover)](../flight_modes_rover/differential.md)
- [Drive Modes (Ackermann Rover)](../flight_modes_rover/ackermann.md)

:::info
The mode sub-topics in this section contain information that is common to all vehicles, but may not be relevant to the normal/default setup.
Generally you should see the vehicle-specific topics first, and navigate to these generalized topics when it becomes relevant.
