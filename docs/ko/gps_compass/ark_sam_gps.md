## 하드웨어 설정

The module comes with a Pixhawk-standard 6pin connector that will plug into the `GPS2` port on recent Pixhawk flight controllers.
It should be mounted front facing, as far away from the flight controller and other electronics as possible.

For more information see [Mounting the GNSS/Compass](../gps_compass/index.md#mounting-the-gnss-compass) and [Hardware Setup](../gps_compass/index.md#hardware-setup).

## PX4 설정

The module should be plug-n-play when used with the `GPS2` port on most flight controllers.

[Secondary GPS Configuration (UART)](../gps_compass/index.md#secondary-gps-configuration-uart) explains how you can configure the port if the GPS is not detected (note, that the configuration is the same, even if you are using GPS 2 as the primary compass).
