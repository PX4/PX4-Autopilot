Before flying you should ensure that your vehicle is calibrated and configured, and that you have followed the instructions in the [Safety](../config/safety.md) section.
In particular, you should set appropriate [Safety Failsafes](../config/safety.md) and a [Geofence](../flying/geofence.md).
You should also read the [First Flight Guidelines](../flying/first_flight_guidelines.md).

Basic instructions for flying are covered in the vehicle-specfic topics:

- [Multicopter](../flying/basic_flying_mc.md)
- [Fixed-wing](../flying/basic_flying_fw.md)

How to fly an autonomous mission is covered in [Missions](../flying/missions.md).
