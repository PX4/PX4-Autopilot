# Flight Controller/Sensor Orientation

By default the flight controller and external compass(es) (if present) should be placed on the frame top-side up, oriented so that the arrow points towards the front of the vehicle.
If the board or any external compasses are mounted in any other orientation then you will need configure this in the firmware.

## Calculating Orientation

ROLL, PITCH and/or YAW offsets of the flight controller are calculated relative to the vehicle around the forward (x), right (y), down (z) axes.

![Frame Heading](../../assets/concepts/frame_heading.png)

The axes to rotate around stay the same from one rotation step to the next one.
So the frame to perform the rotation in stays fixed.
This is also known as _extrinsic rotation_.

For example, the vehicles shown below have rotations around the z-axis (i.e. yaw only) corresponding to: `ROTATION_NONE`, `ROTATION_YAW_90`,`ROTATION_YAW_180`,`ROTATION_YAW_270`.

::: info
For a VTOL Tailsitter airframe set the vehicle orientation according to its multirotor configuration (i.e. relative to the vehicle during, takeoff, hovering, landing) for all sensor calibrations.

The axis are normally relative to the orientation of the vehicle during steady forward flight.
For more information see [Basic Concepts](../getting_started/px4_basic_concepts.md#heading-and-directions).

## Setting the Flight Controller Orientation

To set the orientations:

1. Start _QGroundControl_ and connect the vehicle.
1. Select **"Q" icon > Vehicle Setup > Sensors** (sidebar) to open _Sensor Setup_.
1. Select the **Orientations** button.

1. Select the **AutoPilot Orientation** (as [calculated above](#calculating-orientation)).

   ![Orientation options](../../assets/qgc/setup/sensor/sensor_orientation_selector_values.jpg)

1. Press **OK**.

::: info
You can use [Level Horizon Calibration](../config/level_horizon_calibration.md) to compensate for small miss-alignments in controller orientation and to level the horizon in flight view.

## Setting the Compass Orientation

PX4 will automatically detect the compass orientation as part of [compass calibration](../config/compass.md) ([by default](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#SENS_MAG_AUTOROT)) for any of the [standard MAVLink orientations](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#MAV_SENSOR_ORIENTATION) (upright and facing forward, or any multiple of 45Â° offset in any axis) .

::: info
You can confirm that auto detection worked by looking at the [CAL_MAGn_ROT](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#CAL_MAG0_ROT) parameters.
:::

If a non-standard orientation has been used you will need to set the [CAL_MAGx_ROLL](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#CAL_MAG0_ROLL), [CAL_MAGx_PITCH](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#CAL_MAG0_PITCH), and [CAL_MAGx_YAW](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#CAL_MAG0_YAW) parameters for each compass to the angles that were used.

This will automatically set [CAL_MAGn_ROT](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#CAL_MAG0_ROT) to "custom euler angle" and prevents automatic calibration for the selected compass (even if [SENS_MAG_AUTOROT](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#SENS_MAG_AUTOROT) is set).
