## Debugging with Zubax Babel

A great tool to debug the transmission on the CAN bus is the [Zubax Babel](https://zubax.com/products/babel) in combination with the [GUI tool](http://dronecan.github.io/GUI_Tool/Overview/).

They can also be used independently from Pixhawk hardware in order to test a node or manually control DroneCAN enabled ESCs.
