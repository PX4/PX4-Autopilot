# Sky-Drones SmartAP PDB

[SmartAP PDB](https://sky-drones.com/power/smartap-pdb.html) (Power Distribution Board) is used to simplify the distribution of power from one or more batteries to ESCs (motors), flight controller, and other peripherals.
It also acts as a [power module](../power_module/index.md), enabling battery voltage and current measurements.
SmartAP PDB makes connecting high-power lines easier and much more reliable.

The two big pads are intended for the main battery connection.
Up to two independent batteries can be connected using the thick wires (e.g. 8-10 AWG) to be able to handle high current loads and higher total capacity.
Up to 12 ESCs can be connected using the 6 smaller pads on top, bottom, left and right sides.

## Voltage and current sensors

SmartAP PDB has integrated voltage and current sensors.
The current sensor is located on the bottom side of the PDB.
