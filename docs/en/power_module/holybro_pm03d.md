# Holybro PM03D Power Module

The PM03D Power Module acts as both a Power Module (PM) and a Power Distribution Board (PDB).
In addition to providing regulated power to Pixhawk v5X and the ESCs, it sends information to the autopilot about battery voltage and current supplied to the flight controller and the motors.

The power module is connected using the I2C protocol.
It is designed for flight controllers based on the Pixhawk FMUv5X and FMUv6X open standard, including the [Pixhawk 5X](../flight_controller/pixhawk5x.md).

::: info
The PM is **NOT** compatible with flight controllers that require an analog power module, including: [Pixhawk 4](../flight_controller/pixhawk4.md), [Durandal](../flight_controller/durandal.md), [Pix32 v5](../flight_controller/holybro_pix32_v5.md), etc.
