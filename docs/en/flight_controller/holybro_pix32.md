# Holybro pix32 Flight Controller (Discontinued)

<Badge type="info" text="Discontinued" />

:::warning
PX4 does not manufacture this (or any) autopilot.
Contact the [manufacturer](https://holybro.com/) for hardware support or compliance issues.
:::

The Holybro<sup>&reg;</sup> [pix32 autopilot](https://holybro.com/collections/autopilot-flight-controllers/products/pix32pixhawk-flight-controller) (also known as "Pixhawk 2", and formerly as HKPilot32) is based on the [Pixhawk<sup>&reg;</sup>-project](https://pixhawk.org/) **FMUv2** open hardware design.
This board is based on hardware version Pixhawk 2.4.6.
It runs the PX4 flight stack on the [NuttX](https://nuttx.apache.org/) OS.

:::tip
The Holybro pix32 is software compatible with the [3DR Pixhawk 1](../flight_controller/pixhawk.md).
It is not connector compatible, but is otherwise physically very similar to the 3DR Pixhawk or mRo Pixhawk.

## Building Firmware

:::tip
Most users will not need to build this firmware!
It is pre-built and automatically installed by _QGroundControl_ when appropriate hardware is connected.
:::

To [build PX4](../dev_setup/building_px4.md) for this target:

```
make px4_fmu-v2_default
```

## Debug Port

See [3DR Pixhawk 1 > Debug Ports](../flight_controller/pixhawk.md#debug-ports).

## Pinouts and Schematics

The board is based on the [Pixhawk project](https://pixhawk.org/) **FMUv2** open hardware design.
