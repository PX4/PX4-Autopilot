:::

The [Holybro Kakute H7 mini](https://holybro.com/collections/autopilot-flight-controllers/products/kakute-h7-mini) flight controller is intended for lightweight frame builds (such as racers, etc.).

This flight controller is full of features including HD camera plug, dual plug-and-play 4in1 ESC ports, VTX ON/OFF Pit Switch (Battery Voltage), barometer, OSD, 6x UARTs, 128MB Flash for logging (not supported with PX4 yet), 5V BEC, and bigger soldering pad with easy layout and much more.

The Kakute H7 mini builds upon the best features of its predecessor, the [Kakute F7](../flight_controller/kakutef7.md), and the [Kakute H7](../flight_controller/kakuteh7.md). The board also has an on-board barometer, LED & buzzer pad, and I2C pad (SDA & SCL) for external GPS/magnetometers.

## PX4 Bootloader Update

The board comes pre-installed with [Betaflight](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/wiki).
Before the PX4 firmware can be installed, the _PX4 bootloader_ must be flashed.
Download the [holybro_kakuteh7mini_bootloader.hex](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-user_guide/raw/main/assets/flight_controller/kakuteh7mini/holybro_kakuteh7mini_bootloader.hex) bootloader binary and read [this page](../advanced_config/bootloader_update_from_betaflight.md) for flashing instructions.

## Building Firmware

To [build PX4](../dev_setup/building_px4.md) for this target:

```
make holybro_kakuteh7mini_default
```

## Installing PX4 Firmware

::: info
If you are loading the pre-built firmware via QGroundcontrol, you must use QGC Daily or QGC version newer than 4.1.7.
Prior to that release you will need to manually build and install the firmware.
:::

Firmware can be manually installed in any of the normal ways:

- Build and upload the source:

  ```
  make holybro_kakuteh7mini_default upload
  ```

- [Load the firmware](../config/firmware.md) using _QGroundControl_.
  You can use either pre-built firmware or your own custom firmware.

::: info
KakuteH7mini is supported with PX4 main and v1.14 or newer.

## PX4 Configuration

In addition to the [basic configuration](../config/index.md), the following parameters are important:

| Parameter                                                            | Setting                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [SYS_HAS_MAG](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#SYS_HAS_MAG) | This should be disabled since the board does not have an internal mag. You can enable it if you attach an external mag. |

## Serial Port Mapping

| UART   | Device     | Port                  |
| ------ | ---------- | --------------------- |
| USART1 | /dev/ttyS0 | TELEM1                |
| UART2  | /dev/ttyS1 | TELEM2                |
| USART3 | /dev/ttyS2 | Debug Console         |
| UART4  | /dev/ttyS3 | GPS1                  |
| USART6 | /dev/ttyS4 | RC SBUS               |
| UART7  | /dev/ttyS5 | ESC telemetry (DShot) |

## Debug Port

### System Console

UART3 RX and TX are configured for use as the [System Console](../debug/system_console.md).

### SWD

The [SWD interface](../debug/swd_debug.md) (JTAG) pins are:

- `SWCLK`: Test Point 2 (Pin 72 on the CPU)
- `SWDIO`: Test Point 3 (Pin 76 on CPU)
- `GND`: As marked on board
- `VDD_3V3`: As marked on board
