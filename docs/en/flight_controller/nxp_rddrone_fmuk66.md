## Building Firmware

:::tip
Most users will not need to build this firmware!
It is pre-built and automatically installed by _QGroundControl_ when appropriate hardware is connected.
:::

To [build PX4](../dev_setup/building_px4.md) for this target:

```
make nxp_fmuk66-v3_default
```

## Debug Port

The [PX4 System Console](../debug/system_console.md) and the [SWD interface](../debug/swd_debug.md) run on the [DCD-LZ FMU Debug](https://nxp.gitbook.io/hovergames/rddrone-fmuk66/connectors/debug-interface-dcd-lz) port.

NXP's DCD-LZ is a 7 pin JST-GH connector and adds the nRST/MCU_RESET pin to the [Pixhawk 6-Pin standard debug port](https://github.com/pixhawk/Pixhawk-Standards/blob/master/DS-009%20Pixhawk%20Connector%20Standard.pdf).

The DCD-LZ breakout adapter permits the use of a standard 10 pin JTAG/SWD interface (i.e. using the Segger Jlink) and a standard 5 pin FTDI USB-TTL-3V3 type cable.
