## Introduction

The Pixhawk® 6C Mini is the latest update to the successful family of Pixhawk® flight controllers.

Inside the Pixhawk® 6C Mini, you can find an STMicroelectronics® based STM32H743, paired with sensor technology from Bosch® & InvenSense®, giving you flexibility and reliability for controlling any autonomous vehicle, suitable for both academic and commercial applications.

The Pixhawk® 6C Mini's H7 microcontroller contain the Arm® Cortex®-M7 core running up to 480 MHz, and has 2MB flash memory and 1MB RAM.
Thanks to the updated processing power, developers can be more productive and efficient with their development work, allowing for complex algorithms and models.

The Pixhawk 6C Mini includes high-performance, low-noise IMUs on board, designed to be cost effective while having IMU redundancy.
A vibration isolation System to filter out high-frequency vibration and reduce noise to ensure accurate readings, allowing vehicles to reach better overall flight performances.

The Pixhawk® 6C Mini is perfect for developers at corporate research labs, startups, academics (research, professors, students), and commercial applications.

**Key Design Points**

- High performance STM32H743 Processor with more computing power & RAM
- New cost-effective design with low-profile form factor
- Newly designed integrated vibration isolation system to filter out high frequency vibration and reduce noise to ensure accurate readings

## Assembly/Setup

The Pixhawk 4 Mini's port is very similar to the Pixhawk 6C Mini's port.
Please refer to the [Pixhawk 4 Mini Wiring Quick Start](../assembly/quick_start_pixhawk4_mini.md) as it provides instructions on how to assemble required/important peripherals including GPS, Power Module etc.

## Voltage Ratings

_Pixhawk 6C Mini_ can be double-redundant on the power supply if two power sources are supplied. The two power rails are: **POWER1** and **USB**.

**Normal Operation Maximum Ratings**

Under these conditions, all power sources will be used in this order to power the system:

1. **POWER1** inputs (4.9V to 5.5V)
1. **USB** input (4.75V to 5.25V)

**Absolute Maximum Ratings**

Under these conditions, the system will not draw any power (will not be operational), but will remain intact.

1. **POWER1** inputs (operational range 4.1V to 5.7V, 0V to 10V undamaged)
1. **USB** input (operational range 4.1V to 5.7V, 0V to 6V undamaged)
1. Servo input: VDD_SERVO pin of **FMU PWM OUT** and **I/O PWM OUT** (0V to 42V undamaged)

**Voltage monitoring**

Pixhawk 6C Mini uses analog power modules.

Holybro makes various analog [power modules](../power_module/index.md) for different needs:

| Pin     | Signal           | Volt  |
| ------- | ---------------- | ----- |
| 1 (red) | `Vtref`          | +3.3V |
| 2 (blk) | Console TX (OUT) | +3.3V |
| 3 (blk) | Console RX (IN)  | +3.3V |
| 4 (blk) | `SWDIO`          | +3.3V |
| 5 (blk) | `SWCLK`          | +3.3V |
| 6 (blk) | `GND`            | GND   |
