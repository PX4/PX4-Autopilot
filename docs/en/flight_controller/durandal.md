PX4 does not manufacture this (or any) autopilot.
Contact the [manufacturer](https://holybro.com/) for hardware support or compliance issues.
:::

_Durandal_<sup>&reg;</sup> is the latest update to the successful family of Holybro flight controllers.
It was designed and developed by Holybro.

![Durandal](../../assets/flight_controller/durandal/durandal_hero.jpg)

At high level, some of the key features are:

- Integrated temperature control for sensors.
- Powerful STM32H7 microcontroller running at 480MHz.
  2 MB of Flash memory and 1 MB of RAM.
- New sensors with higher temperature stability.
- Internal vibration isolation system.
- Dual high-performance, low-noise IMUs on board are designed for demanding stabilization applications.

A summary of the key features, [assembly](../assembly/quick_start_durandal.md), and [purchase](#purchase) links can be found below.

::: info

## Voltage Ratings

*Pixhawk 4* can be triple-redundant on the power supply if three power sources are supplied. The three power rails are: **POWER1**, **POWER2** and **USB**.

::: info
The output power rails **FMU PWM OUT** and **I/O PWM OUT** (0V to 36V) do not power the flight controller board (and are not powered by it).
You must supply power to one of **POWER1**, **POWER2** or **USB** or the board will be unpowered.
:::

**Normal Operation Maximum Ratings**

Under these conditions all power sources will be used in this order to power the system:
1. **POWER1** and **POWER2** inputs (4.9V to 5.5V)
1. **USB** input (4.75V to 5.25V)
-->

<!--
**Absolute Maximum Ratings**

Under these conditions the system will not draw any power (will not be operational), but will remain intact.
1. **POWER1** and **POWER2** inputs (operational range 4.1V to 5.7V, 0V to 10V undamaged)
1. **USB** input (operational range 4.1V to 5.7V, 0V to 6V undamaged)
1. Servo input: VDD_SERVO pin of **FMU PWM OUT** and **I/O PWM OUT** (0V to 42V undamaged)

-->

## Assembly/Setup

The [Durandal Wiring Quick Start](../assembly/quick_start_durandal.md) provides instructions on how to assemble required/important peripherals including GPS, Power Management Board etc.

## Building Firmware

:::tip
Most users will not need to build this firmware!
It is pre-built and automatically installed by _QGroundControl_ when appropriate hardware is connected.

## Debug Port

The [PX4 System Console](../debug/system_console.md) and [SWD interface](../debug/swd_debug.md) run on the _Debug Port_.

The pinouts and connector comply with the [Pixhawk Debug Mini](../debug/swd_debug.md#pixhawk-debug-mini) interface defined in the [Pixhawk Connector Standard](https://github.com/pixhawk/Pixhawk-Standards/blob/master/DS-009%20Pixhawk%20Connector%20Standard.pdf).

For wiring and debugging information see the above links.

::: info
No Debug port is exposed for the I/O board.
