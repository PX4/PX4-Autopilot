:::

The _mRo Control Zero F7<sup>&reg;</sup>_ is a new flight controller from mRo.

![mRo Control Zero F7](../../assets/flight_controller/mro_control_zero_f7/mro_control_zero_f7.jpg)

It is a no-compromise triple IMU commercial grade flight controller.
It includes 8x PWM outputs (DShot capable), 3x IMUs, 1x Magnetometer, 1x Barometric Pressure Sensor (Altimeter), 6x UART, and SD Card, all packed into a 32mm x 20mm PCB.
The PWMs are bidirectional, EMI protected, and level shifted to 5V logic levels.
All accessed using front and rear 30pin Molex PicoClasp connectors.
A durable plastic case, conformal board coating, and optional temperature calibration included.

::: info
This flight controller is [manufacturer supported](../flight_controller/autopilot_manufacturer_supported.md).

## Building Firmware

:::tip
Most users will not need to build this firmware!
It is pre-built and automatically installed by _QGroundControl_ when appropriate hardware is connected.
:::

To [build PX4](../dev_setup/building_px4.md) for this target:

```
make mro_ctrl-zero-f7
```

## Debug Ports

### Console Port

The [PX4 System Console](../debug/system_console.md) runs on `USART7` using the pins listed below.
This is a standard serial pinout, designed to connect to a [3.3V FTDI](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/TTL-232R-3V3/768-1015-ND/1836393) cable (5V tolerant).

| mRo control zero f7 |             | FTDI |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ---- |
| 17                  | USART7 Tx   | 5    | FTDI RX (yellow) |
| 19                  | USART7 Rx   | 4    | FTDI TX (orange) |
| 6                   | USART21 GND | 1    | FTDI GND (black) |

### SWD Port

The [SWD port](../debug/swd_debug.md) (JTAG) for FMU debugging is a TC2030 debug connector, as shown below.

![mro swd port](../../assets/flight_controller/mro_control_zero_f7/mro_control_zero_f7_swd.jpg)

You can use the [Tag Connect](https://www.tag-connect.com/) cable [TC2030 IDC NL](https://www.tag-connect.com/product/tc2030-idc-nl) below (with associated [retaining clip](https://www.tag-connect.com/product/tc2030-clip-retaining-clip-board-for-tc2030-nl-cables)) to attach to either a BlackMagic probe or a ST-LINK V2 debugger.

![tc2030 idc nl cable](../../assets/flight_controller/mro_control_zero_f7/tc2030_idc_nl.jpg)

There is also an [ARM20-CTX 20-Pin to TC2030-IDC adapter](https://www.tag-connect.com/product/arm20-ctx-20-pin-to-tc2030-idc-adapter-for-cortex) that can be used with other debug probes.
