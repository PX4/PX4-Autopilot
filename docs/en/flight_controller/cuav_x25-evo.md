### Features

- Arm速 Cortex-M7速 processor (STM32H743XI) with Floating-Point Unit (FPU), operating at 480MHz, and featuring 2MB Flash memory. Enables developers to enhance productivity and efficiency, allowing for more complex algorithms and models.
- Automotive-grade RM3100 compass. Designed for better stability and anti-interference capability.
- Triple-redundant IMUs and dual-redundant barometers located on separate buses. If the PX4 autopilot detects a sensor failure, the system seamlessly switches to another sensor to maintain flight control reliability.
- Independent LDO power control supplies power to each sensor group. A vibration isolation system filters high-frequency vibrations and reduces noise to ensure accurate readings, enabling better overall flight performance for the vehicle.
- Integrated Microchip Ethernet PHY for high-speed communication with onboard devices like mission computers via Ethernet.
- Dual temperature compensation systems, located on the IMU board and FMU board respectively. Temperature is controlled by onboard heating resistors to achieve the optimal operating temperature for the IMUs.
- PWM servo output voltage switchable between 3.3V or 5V.
- Modular design for DIY carrier boards.

## Serial Port Mapping

| UART   | Device     | Port          |
| ------ | ---------- | ------------- |
| USART1 | /dev/ttyS0 | GPS1          |
| USART2 | /dev/ttyS1 | GPS2          |
| USART3 | /dev/ttyS2 | Debug Console |
| UART4  | /dev/ttyS3 | UART4         |
| UART5  | /dev/ttyS4 | TELEM2        |

## Voltage Ratings

The _X25-EVO_ achieves triple redundancy on power supplies if three power sources are provided. The three power rails are POWERC1, POWERC2, and USB.
- **POWER C1** and **POWER C2** are DroneCAN/UAVCAN battery interfaces.

**Normal Operation Maximum Ratings**

Under these conditions, all power sources will be used to power the system in the following order:
1. **POWER C1** and **POWER C2** Inputs (10V to 18V)
2. USB Input (4.75V to 5.25V)

**Voltage monitoring**

Digital DroneCAN/UAVCAN battery monitoring is enabled by default.

## Building Firmware

:::tip
Most users do not need to build this firmware!
It is pre-built and installed automatically by _QGroundControl_ when the appropriate hardware is connected.
:::

To [build PX4](../dev_setup/building_px4.md) for this target, execute:

```
make cuav_x25-evo_default
```
