# Flight Controller (Autopilot) Hardware

Flight Controllers (FCs) are the autopilot hardware onto which PX4 firmware is uploaded.
This section contains topics about compatible flight controller and baseboard hardware, and how it is mounted and configured.

## Selecting a Flight Controller

Information about how to choose a PX4-compatible flight controller and the available controllers:

- [Flight Controller Selection](../getting_started/flight_controller_selection.md)
- [Pixhawk Standard/Supported Autopilots](../flight_controller/autopilot_pixhawk_standard.md)
- [Manufacturer-Supported Autopilots](../flight_controller/autopilot_manufacturer_supported.md)
- [Experimental Autopilots](../flight_controller/autopilot_experimental.md)
- [Discontinued Autopilots & Complete Vehicles](../flight_controller/autopilot_discontinued.md)
- [Pixhawk Autopilot Bus & Carriers](../flight_controller/pixhawk_autopilot_bus.md)

::: info
There may be other [Pixhawk Series](../flight_controller/pixhawk_series.md) compatible flight controllers and variants, including those [documented here on Github](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/#supported-hardware).
