# Pixhack V3

:::warning
PX4 does not manufacture this (or any) autopilot.

:::

The CUAV _Pixhack V3_ flight controller board is a flexible autopilot intended primarily for manufacturers of commercial systems.

The board is a variant of the SOLO Pixhawk<sup>&reg;</sup> 2 (PH2) flight controller, which is in turn based on the [Pixhawk-project](https://pixhawk.org/) **FMUv3** open hardware design.
It runs PX4 on the [NuttX](https://nuttx.apache.org/) OS, and is fully compatible with both PX4 or ArduPilot<sup>&reg;</sup> (APM) firmware.

_Pixhack V3_ has significant improvements with respect to the original design, including better interface layout and the addition of vibration damping and a thermostat system.

## Building Firmware

:::tip
Most users will not need to build this firmware!
It is pre-built and automatically installed by _QGroundControl_ when appropriate hardware is connected.
:::

To [build PX4](../dev_setup/building_px4.md) for this target:

```
make px4_fmu-v3_default
```
