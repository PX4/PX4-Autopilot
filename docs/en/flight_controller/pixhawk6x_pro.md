## Key Design Points

- High-performance ADIS16470 Industrial IMU with high accelerometer dynamic range (±40 g), perfect for accurate motion sensing in demanding UAV applications
- All new advanced durable vibration isolation material with resonance frequency in the higher spectrum, ideal for industrial and commercial drone applications
- High performance STM32H753 Processor
- Ethernet interface for high-speed mission computer integration

## Baseboards

The Pixhawk 6X Pro can be purchased with a number of baseboards (or no baseboard) to suit different use cases and vehicle types, including [Standard v2A](https://docs.holybro.com/autopilot/pixhawk-baseboards/pixhawk-baseboard-v2-ports), [Standard v2B](https://docs.holybro.com/autopilot/pixhawk-baseboards/pixhawk-baseboard-v2-ports), and [Mini](https://docs.holybro.com/autopilot/pixhawk-baseboards/pixhawk-mini-baseboard-ports), which are shown below.
It can also be used with any other Pixhawk Autopilot Bus (PAB) specification-compliant baseboard, such as the [Holybro Pixhawk Jetson Baseboard](../companion_computer/holybro_pixhawk_jetson_baseboard.md) and [Holybro Pixhawk RPi CM4 Baseboard](../companion_computer/holybro_pixhawk_rpi_cm4_baseboard.md).

## Dimensions

## Voltage Ratings

_Pixhawk 6X Pro_ can be triple-redundant on the power supply if three power sources are supplied.
The three power rails are: **POWER1**, **POWER2** and **USB**.
The **POWER1** & **POWER2** ports on the Pixhawk 6X uses the 6 circuit [2.00mm Pitch CLIK-Mate Wire-to-Board PCB Receptacle](https://www.molex.com/molex/products/part-detail/pcb_receptacles/5024430670).

**Normal Operation Maximum Ratings**

Under these conditions all power sources will be used in this order to power the system:

1. **POWER1** and **POWER2** inputs (4.9V to 5.5V)
1. **USB** input (4.75V to 5.25V)

**Absolute Maximum Ratings**

Under these conditions the system will not draw any power (will not be operational), but will remain intact.

1. **POWER1** and **POWER2** inputs (operational range 4.1V to 5.7V, 0V to 10V undamaged)
1. **USB** input (operational range 4.1V to 5.7V, 0V to 6V undamaged)
1. Servo input: VDD_SERVO pin of **FMU PWM OUT** and **I/O PWM OUT** (0V to 42V undamaged)

**Voltage monitoring**

Digital I2C battery monitoring is enabled by default (see [Quickstart > Power](../assembly/quick_start_pixhawk6x.md#power)).

::: info
Analog battery monitoring via an ADC is not supported on this particular board, but may be supported in variations of this flight controller with a different baseboard.

## Building Firmware

:::tip
Most users will not need to build this firmware!
It is pre-built and automatically installed by _QGroundControl_ when appropriate hardware is connected.
:::

To [build PX4](../dev_setup/building_px4.md) for this target:

```
make px4_fmu-v6x_default
```

## Debug Port

The [PX4 System Console](../debug/system_console.md) and [SWD interface](../debug/swd_debug.md) run on the **FMU Debug** port.

The pinouts and connector comply with the [Pixhawk Debug Full](../debug/swd_debug.md#pixhawk-debug-full) interface defined in the [Pixhawk Connector Standard](https://github.com/pixhawk/Pixhawk-Standards/blob/master/DS-009%20Pixhawk%20Connector%20Standard.pdf) interface (JST SM10B connector).

| Pin      | Signal           | Volt  |
| -------- | ---------------- | ----- |
| 1 (red)  | `Vtref`          | +3.3V |
| 2 (blk)  | Console TX (OUT) | +3.3V |
| 3 (blk)  | Console RX (IN)  | +3.3V |
| 4 (blk)  | `SWDIO`          | +3.3V |
| 5 (blk)  | `SWCLK`          | +3.3V |
| 6 (blk)  | `SWO`            | +3.3V |
| 7 (blk)  | NFC GPIO         | +3.3V |
| 8 (blk)  | PH11             | +3.3V |
| 9 (blk)  | nRST             | +3.3V |
| 10 (blk) | `GND`            | GND   |

For information about using this port see:

- [SWD Debug Port](../debug/swd_debug.md)
- [PX4 System Console](../debug/system_console.md) (Note, the FMU console maps to USART3).
