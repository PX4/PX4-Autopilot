# mRo Pixhawk Flight Controller (Pixhawk 1)

:::warning
PX4 does not manufacture this (or any) autopilot.
Contact the [manufacturer](https://store.mrobotics.io/) for hardware support or compliance issues.
:::

The _mRo Pixhawk<sup>&reg;</sup>_ is a hardware compatible version of the original [Pixhawk 1](../flight_controller/pixhawk.md). It runs PX4 on the [NuttX](https://nuttx.apache.org/) OS.

:::tip
The controller can be used as a drop-in replacement for the 3DR<sup>&reg;</sup> [Pixhawk 1](../flight_controller/pixhawk.md).
The main difference is that it is based on the [Pixhawk-project](https://pixhawk.org/) **FMUv3** open hardware design, which corrects a bug that limited the original Pixhawk 1 to 1MB of flash.

:::tip
This autopilot is [supported](../flight_controller/autopilot_pixhawk_standard.md) by the PX4 maintenance and test teams.

## Building Firmware

:::tip
Most users will not need to build this firmware!
It is pre-built and automatically installed by _QGroundControl_ when appropriate hardware is connected.
:::

To [build PX4](../dev_setup/building_px4.md) for this target:

```
make px4_fmu-v3_default
```
