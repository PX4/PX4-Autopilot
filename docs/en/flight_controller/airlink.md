::: info
This flight controller is [manufacturer supported](../flight_controller/autopilot_manufacturer_supported.md).
:::

AIRLink has two computers and integrated LTE Module:

- The flight control computer (autopilot) has a triple-redundant vibration-dampened and temperature-stabilized IMU.
- The powerful AI mission computer enables advanced drone software features like computer vision and obstacle avoidance, digital HD video streaming, and payload data streaming.
- LTE/5G and WiFi connectivity modules provide permanent broadband internet connection which is enabler for remote workflows.

## Editions

There are AIRLink editions that offer different integration levels required by drone manufacturers: _Enterprise_ and _Core_.
AIRLink Enterprise is ideal for a quick start, evaluation and prototyping while Core is optimised for deep integration and mid-high volume manufacturing.

**AIRLink Enterprise**

SmartAP AIRLink's Enterprise edition is intended for prototyping and low to medium volume drone production.
Quick and easy installation thanks to the dedicated mounting holes and integrated heatsink for power dissipation.

![AIRLink Enterprise](../../assets/flight_controller/airlink/airlink-enterprise.jpg)

**AIRLink Core**

SmartAP AIRLink's Core edition is intended for medium to high volume production and deep integration with customer's hardware. It weighs only 89 g and can be attached to a metal frame for optimum cooling.
