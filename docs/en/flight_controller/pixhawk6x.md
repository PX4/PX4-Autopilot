## Introduction

Inside the Pixhawk®​ 6X, you can find an STMicroelectronics​® based STM32H753, paired with sensor technology from Bosch®​​, InvenSense®​,​ giving you flexibility and reliability for controlling any autonomous vehicle, suitable for both academic and commercial applications.

The Pixhawk® 6X's H7 microcontroller contain the Arm® Cortex®-M7 core running up to 480 MHz, has 2MB flash memory and 1MB RAM. The PX4 Autopilot takes advantage of the increased power and RAM. Thanks to the updated processing power, developers can be more productive and efficient with their development work, allowing for complex algorithms and models.

The FMUv6X open standard includes high-performance, low-noise IMUs on board, designed for better stabilization. Triple redundant IMU & double redundant barometer on separate buses. When the PX4 Autopilot detects a sensor failure, the system seamlessly switches to another to maintain flight control reliability.

An independent LDO powers every sensor set with independent power control. A vibration isolation System to filter out high-frequency vibration and reduce noise to ensure accurate readings, allowing vehicles to reach better overall flight performances.

External sensor bus (SPI5) has two chip select lines and data-ready signals for additional sensors and payload with SPI-interface, and with an integrated Microchip Ethernet PHY, high-speed communication with mission computers via ethernet is now possible.

The Pixhawk®​ 6X is perfect for developers at corporate research labs, startups, academics (research, professors, students), and commercial application.

## Voltage Ratings

_Pixhawk 6X_ can be triple-redundant on the power supply if three power sources are supplied. The three power rails are: **POWER1**, **POWER2** and **USB**.
The **POWER1** & **POWER2** ports on the Pixhawk 6X uses the 6 circuit [2.00mm Pitch CLIK-Mate Wire-to-Board PCB Receptacle](https://www.molex.com/molex/products/part-detail/pcb_receptacles/5024430670).

**Normal Operation Maximum Ratings**

Under these conditions all power sources will be used in this order to power the system:

1. **POWER1** and **POWER2** inputs (4.9V to 5.5V)
1. **USB** input (4.75V to 5.25V)

**Absolute Maximum Ratings**

Under these conditions the system will not draw any power (will not be operational), but will remain intact.

1. **POWER1** and **POWER2** inputs (operational range 4.1V to 5.7V, 0V to 10V undamaged)
1. **USB** input (operational range 4.1V to 5.7V, 0V to 6V undamaged)
1. Servo input: VDD_SERVO pin of **FMU PWM OUT** and **I/O PWM OUT** (0V to 42V undamaged)

**Voltage monitoring**

Digital I2C battery monitoring is enabled by default (see [Quickstart > Power](../assembly/quick_start_pixhawk6x.md#power)).

::: info
Analog battery monitoring via an ADC is not supported on this particular board, but may be supported in variations of this flight controller with a different baseboard.
