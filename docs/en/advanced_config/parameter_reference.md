## UAVCAN Motor Parameters

### ctl_bw (`INT32`) {#ctl_bw}

Speed controller bandwidth.

Speed controller bandwidth, in Hz. Higher values result in faster speed and current rise times, but may result in overshoot and higher current consumption. For fixed-wing aircraft, this value should be less than 50 Hz; for multirotors, values up to 100 Hz may provide improvements in responsiveness.

Reboot | minValue | maxValue | increment | default | unit
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
&nbsp; | 10 | 250 |  | 75 | Hz 

### ctl_dir (`INT32`) {#ctl_dir}

### ctl_gain (`FLOAT`) {#ctl_gain}

Speed (RPM) controller gain.

Determines controller
            aggressiveness; units are amp-seconds per radian. Systems with
            higher rotational inertia (large props) will need gain increased;
            systems with low rotational inertia (small props) may need gain
            decreased. Higher values result in faster response, but may result
            in oscillation and excessive overshoot. Lower values result in a
            slower, smoother response.

### PCA9685_PWM_FREQ (`FLOAT`) {#PCA9685_PWM_FREQ}

PWM cycle frequency.

Controls the PWM frequency at timing perspective. This is independent from PWM update frequency, as PCA9685 is capable to output without being continuously commanded by FC. Higher frequency leads to more accurate pulse width, but some ESCs and servos may not support it. This parameter should be set to the same value as PWM update rate in most case. This parameter MUST NOT exceed upper limit of 400.0, if any outputs as generic 1000~2000us pulse width is desired. Frequency higher than 400 only makes sense in duty-cycle mode.

Type of magnetometer fusion.

Integer controlling the type of magnetometer fusion used - magnetic heading or 3-component vector. The fusion of magnetometer data as a three component vector enables vehicle body fixed hard iron errors to be learned, but requires a stable earth field. If set to 'Automatic' magnetic heading fusion is used when on-ground and 3-axis magnetic field fusion in-flight. If set to 'Magnetic heading' magnetic heading fusion is used at all times. If set to 'None' the magnetometer will not be used under any circumstance. If no external source of yaw is available, it is possible to use post-takeoff horizontal movement combined with GNSS velocity measurements to align the yaw angle. If set to 'Init' the magnetometer is only used to initalize the heading.

### EKF2_MCOEF (`FLOAT`) {#EKF2_MCOEF}

Propeller momentum drag coefficient for multi-rotor wind estimation.

This parameter controls the prediction of drag produced by the propellers when flying a multi-copter, which enables estimation of wind drift when enabled by the EKF2_DRAG_CTRL parameter. The drag produced by this effect scales with speed not speed squared and is produced because some of the air velocity normal to the propeller axis of rotation is lost when passing through the rotor disc. This  changes the momentum of the flow which creates a drag reaction force. When comparing un-ducted propellers of the same diameter, the effect is roughly proportional to the area of the propeller blades when viewed side on and changes with propeller selection. Momentum drag is significantly higher for ducted rotors. To account for the drag produced by the body which scales with speed squared, see documentation for the EKF2_BCOEF_X and EKF2_BCOEF_Y parameters. Set this parameter to zero to turn off the momentum drag model for both axis.

### EKF2_RNG_CTRL (`INT32`) {#EKF2_RNG_CTRL}

Range sensor height aiding.

WARNING: Range finder measurements are less reliable and can experience unexpected errors. For these reasons, if accurate control of height relative to ground is required, it is recommended to use the MPC_ALT_MODE parameter instead, unless baro errors are severe enough to cause problems with landing and takeoff. If this parameter is enabled then the estimator will make use of the range finder measurements to estimate its height in addition to other height sources (if activated). Range sensor aiding can be enabled (i.e.: always use) or set in "conditional" mode. Conditional mode: This enables the range finder to be used during low speed (< EKF2_RNG_A_VMAX) and low altitude (< EKF2_RNG_A_HMAX) operation, eg takeoff and landing, where baro interference from rotor wash is excessive and can corrupt EKF state estimates. It is intended to be used where a vertical takeoff and landing is performed, and horizontal flight does not occur until above EKF2_RNG_A_HMAX.

**Values:**

- `0`: Disable range fusion

Enable synthetic magnetometer Z component measurement.

Use for vehicles where the measured body Z magnetic field is subject to strong magnetic interference.

Therefore, this parameter will only have an effect if the global position of the drone is known. For 3D mag fusion the magnetometer Z measurement will simply be ignored instead of fusing the synthetic value.

### SDLOG_BOOT_BAT (`INT32`) {#SDLOG_BOOT_BAT}

Battery-only Logging.

When enabled, logging will not start from boot if battery power is not detected (e.g. powered via USB on a test bench). This prevents extraneous flight logs from being created during bench testing. Note that this only applies to log-from-boot modes. This has no effect on arm-based modes.

Selects the key in keystore, used for encrypting the log. When using a symmetric encryption algorithm, the key is generated at logging start and kept stored in this index. For symmetric algorithms, the key is volatile and valid only for the duration of logging. The key is stored in encrypted format on the sdcard alongside the logfile, using an RSA2048 key defined by the SDLOG_EXCHANGE_KEY

### SDLOG_MISSION (`INT32`) {#SDLOG_MISSION}

Mission Log.

If enabled, a small additional "mission" log file will be written to the SD card. The log contains just those messages that are useful for tasks like generating flight statistics and geotagging. The different modes can be used to further reduce the logged data (and thus the log file size). For example, choose geotagging mode to only log data required for geotagging. Note that the normal/full log is still created, and contains all the data in the mission log (and more).

**Values:**

- `0`: Disabled
- `1`: All mission messages
- `2`: Geotagging messages

### SDLOG_PROFILE (`INT32`) {#SDLOG_PROFILE}

Logging topic profile (integer bitmask).

This integer bitmask controls the set and rates of logged topics. The default allows for general log analysis while keeping the log file size reasonably small. Enabling multiple sets leads to higher bandwidth requirements and larger log files. Set bits true to enable: 0 : Default set (used for general log analysis) 1 : Full rate estimator (EKF2) replay topics 2 : Topics for thermal calibration (high rate raw IMU and Baro sensor data) 3 : Topics for system identification (high rate actuator control and IMU data) 4 : Full rates for analysis of fast maneuvers (RC, attitude, rates and actuators) 5 : Debugging topics (debug_*.msg topics, for custom code) 6 : Topics for sensor comparison (low rate raw IMU, Baro and magnetometer data) 7 : Topics for computer vision and collision prevention 8 : Raw FIFO high-rate IMU (Gyro) 9 : Raw FIFO high-rate IMU (Accel) 10: Logging of mavlink tunnel message (useful for payload communication debugging)

**Bitmask:**

- `0`: Default set (general log analysis)
- `1`: Estimator replay (EKF2)
- `2`: Thermal calibration
- `3`: System identification
- `4`: High rate
- `5`: Debug

This occurs in situations where the two antenna ARPs may not be exactly at the same height in the vehicle reference frame. Since pitch is defined as the right-handed rotation about the vehicle Y axis, a situation where the main antenna is mounted lower than the aux antenna (assuming the default antenna setup) will result in a positive pitch.
