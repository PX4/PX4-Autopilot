# MacOS Development Environment

The following instructions set up a PX4 development environment for macOS.
This environment can be used to build PX4 for:

- Pixhawk and other NuttX-based hardware
- [Gazebo Classic Simulation](../sim_gazebo_classic/index.md)

:::tip
This setup is supported by the PX4 dev team.
To build other targets you will need to use a [different OS](../dev_setup/dev_env.md#supported-targets) (or an [unsupported development environment](../advanced/community_supported_dev_env.md)).

## Base Setup

The "base" macOS setup installs the tools needed for building firmware, and includes the common tools that will be needed for installing/using the simulators.

### Environment Setup

:::details Apple Silicon Macbook users!
If you have an Apple M1, M2 etc. Macbook, make sure to run the terminal as x86 by setting up an x86 terminal:

1. Locate the Terminal application within the Utilities folder (**Finder > Go menu > Utilities**)
2. Select _Terminal.app_ and right-click on it, then choose **Duplicate**.
3. Rename the duplicated Terminal app, e.g. to _x86 Terminal_
4. Now select the renamed _x86 Terminal_ app and right-click and choose \*_Get Info_
5. Check the box for **Open using Rosetta**, then close the window
6. Run the _x86 Terminal_ as usual, which will fully support the current PX4 toolchain
   :::

First set up the environment

1. Enable more open files by appending the following line to the `~/.zshenv` file (creating it if necessary):

   ```sh
   echo ulimit -S -n 2048 >> ~/.zshenv
   ```

   ::: info
   If you don't do this, the build toolchain may report the error: `"LD: too many open files"`
   :::

1. Enforce Python 3 by appending the following lines to `~/.zshenv`

   ```sh
   # Point pip3 to MacOS system python 3 pip
   alias pip3=/usr/bin/pip3
   ```

### Common Tools

To setup the environment to be able to build for Pixhawk/NuttX hardware (and install the common tools for using simulators):

1. Install Homebrew by following these [installation instructions](https://brew.sh).
1. Run these commands in your shell to install the common tools:

   ```sh
   brew tap PX4/px4
   brew install px4-dev
   ```

1. Install the required Python packages:

   ```sh
   # install required packages using pip3
   python3 -m pip install --user pyserial empty toml numpy pandas jinja2 pyyaml pyros-genmsg packaging kconfiglib future jsonschema
   # if this fails with a permissions error, your Python install is in a system path - use this command instead:
   sudo -H python3 -m pip install --user pyserial empty toml numpy pandas jinja2 pyyaml pyros-genmsg packaging kconfiglib future jsonschema
   ```

## Gazebo Classic Simulation

To setup the environment for [Gazebo Classic](../sim_gazebo_classic/index.md) simulation:

1. Run the following commands in your shell:

   ```sh
   brew unlink tbb
   sed -i.bak '/disable! date:/s/^/  /; /disable! date:/s/./#/3' $(brew --prefix)/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core/Formula/tbb@2020.rb
   brew install tbb@2020
   brew link tbb@2020
   ```

   ::: info
   September 2021: The commands above are a workaround to this bug: [PX4-Autopilot#17644](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/17644).
   They can be removed once it is fixed (along with this note).
   :::

1. To install SITL simulation with Gazebo Classic:

   ```sh
   brew install --cask temurin
   brew install --cask xquartz
   brew install px4-sim-gazebo
   ```

1. Run the macOS setup script: `PX4-Autopilot/Tools/setup/macos.sh`
   The easiest way to do this is to clone the PX4 source, and then run the script from the directory, as shown:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot.git --recursive
   cd PX4-Autopilot/Tools/setup
   sh macos.sh
   ```


## Next Steps

Once you have finished setting up the command-line toolchain:

- Install [VSCode](../dev_setup/vscode.md) (if you prefer using an IDE to the command line).
- Install the [QGroundControl Daily Build](../dev_setup/qgc_daily_build.md)

  :::tip
  The _daily build_ includes development tools that are hidden in release builds.
  It may also provide access to new PX4 features that are not yet supported in release builds.

- Continue to the [build instructions](../dev_setup/building_px4.md).
