# macOS Development Environment

The following instructions set up a PX4 development environment for macOS.
This environment can be used to build PX4 for:

- Pixhawk and other NuttX-based hardware
- [Gazebo Simulation](../sim_gazebo_gz/index.md) (Gazebo Harmonic)

::: tip
This setup is supported by the PX4 dev team.
To build for [other targets](../dev_setup/dev_env.md#supported-targets) you will need to use a [different OS](../dev_setup/dev_env.md#supported-targets) or an [unsupported development environment](../advanced/community_supported_dev_env.md).

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

1. Install Homebrew by following these [installation instructions](https://brew.sh).

2. Enable more open files by appending the following line to the `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc` for zsh)  file or creating it if necessary:

   ```sh
   echo ulimit -S -n 2048 >> ~/.bashrc
   ```

   ::: info
   If you don't do this, the build toolchain may report the error: `"LD: too many open files"`
   :::

3. Enforce Python 3 by appending the following lines to `~/.bashrc`(or `~/.zshrc` for zsh):

   Ensure Python 3 is used by default, as some PX4 scripts require the `python3` and `pip3` executables to be available in your system `PATH`.

   ::: tip
   If you need help installing an updated version of Python 3, we recommend the [pyenv project](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file), which gives you utmost flexibility by allowing you to set a global and local Python version at the per-directory level.
   :::

4. Point pip3 to macOS system python 3 pip

   ```sh
   alias pip3=/usr/bin/pip3
   ```

### Install Development Tools

1. Install the PX4 development toolchain and simulation environment:

   ```sh
   brew tap PX4/px4
   brew install px4-dev px4-sim
   ```

2. ### Download PX4 Source Code

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot.git --recursive
```

4. Prerequisites setup

   Use the [`macos.sh` setup script](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/main/Tools/setup/macos.sh) to automatically install all development dependencies:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot.git --recursive   cd PX4-Autopilot
   ./Tools/setup/macos.sh
   ```

   This script will install all required Homebrew packages, Python dependencies, and perform the necessary setup steps.

## Gazebo Simulation

Gazebo Harmonic simulation support is included with the `px4-sim` formula installed above.
The simulation environment should be ready to use after the installation completes.

## Next Steps

Once you have finished setting up the command-line toolchain:

- Install [VSCode](../dev_setup/vscode.md) (if you prefer using an IDE to the command line).
- Install the [QGroundControl Daily Build](../dev_setup/qgc_daily_build.md)

  :::tip
  The _daily build_ includes development tools that are hidden in release builds.
  It may also provide access to new PX4 features that are not yet supported in release builds.

- Continue to the [build instructions](../dev_setup/building_px4.md).
