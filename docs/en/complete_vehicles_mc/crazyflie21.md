## Flashing PX4

::: info
These instructions have only been tested on Ubuntu.
:::

After setting up the PX4 development environment, follow these steps to install the PX4 Autopilot on the Crazyflie 2.1:

1. Download the source code of the PX4 Bootloader:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/PX4/Bootloader.git --recurse-submodules
   ```

1. Navigate into the top directory of the source code and compile it using:

   ```sh
   make crazyflie21_bl
   ```

1. Put the Crazyflie 2.1 into DFU mode by following these steps:
   - Ensure it is initially unpowered.
   - Ensure battery is disconnected.
   - Hold down the reset button (see figure below...).
     ![Crazyflie2 Reset Button](../../assets/flight_controller/crazyflie/crazyflie_reset_button.jpg)
   - Plug into computer's USB port.
   - After a second, the blue LED should start blinking and after 5 seconds should start blinking faster.
   - Release button.
1. Install _dfu-util_:

   ```sh
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install dfu-util
   ```

1. Flash bootloader using _dfu-util_ and unplug Crazyflie 2.1 when done:

   ```sh
   sudo dfu-util -d 0483:df11 -a 0 -s 0x08000000 -D ./build/crazyflie21_bl/crazyflie21_bl.bin
   ```

   When powering on the Crazyflie 2.1 the yellow LED should blink.

1. Download the source code of the PX4 autopilot:

## Wireless Setup Instructions

The onboard nRF module allows connecting to the board via Bluetooth or through the proprietary 2.4GHz Nordic ESB protocol.

- A [Crazyradio PA](https://www.bitcraze.io/crazyradio-pa/) is recommended.
- To fly the Crazyflie 2.1 right away, the Crazyflie phone app is supported via Bluetooth.

Connecting via **MAVLink**:

- Use a Crazyradio PA alongside a compatible GCS.
- Download the _crazyflie-lib-python_ source code:

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-lib-python.git
  ```

::: info
We will use [cfbridge.py](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-lib-python/blob/master/examples/cfbridge.py) to setup a wireless MAVlink communication link between Crazyflie 2.1 (flashed with PX4) and QGroundControl. _Cfbridge_ enables QGroundControl to communicate with the crazyradio PA.
The [C based cfbridge](https://github.com/dennisss/cfbridge) is currently experiencing data loss issues, which is why we have chosen to use **cfbridge.py**.
:::

- Make sure you have set the udev permissions to use the USB Radio. To do this, follow the steps listed [here](https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/repository/crazyflie-lib-python/master/installation/usb_permissions/) and **restart** your computer.
- Connect a Crazyradio PA via USB.
- Build a [virtual environment (local python environment)](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) with package dependencies using the following method:

  ```sh
  pip install tox --user
  ```

- Navigate to the crazyflie-lib-python folder and type:

  ```sh
  make venv
  ```

- Activate the virtual environment:

  ```sh
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- Install required dependencies:

  ```sh
  pip install cflib
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

To connect Crazyflie 2.1 with crazyradio, **launch cfbridge** by following these steps:

- Power off and power on Crazyflie 2.1 and wait for it to boot up.
- Connect a Crazyflie radio device via USB.
- Navigate to the crazyflie-lib-python folder.
- Activate the environment:

  ```sh
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- Navigate to the examples folder:

  ```sh
  cd examples

  ```

- Launch cfbridge:

  ```sh
  python cfbridge.py
  ```

  ::: info
  _Cfbridge_ by default tries to initiate the radio link communication on channel 80 and with crazyflie address 0xE7E7E7E7E7.
  If you are using [multiple crazyflies and/or crazyradios](https://github.com/dennisss/cfbridge/blob/master/index.md#advanced-swarming) in the same room and want to use a different channel and/or address for each, first connect the crazyflie with QGroundControl via a USB cable and change the syslink parameters (channel, address) in QGroundControl.
  Next, launch the cfbridge by giving the same channel and address as the first and second arguments respectively, e.g: `python cfbridge.py 90 0x0202020202`
  :::

- Open QGroundControl.
- After using _cfbridge_, you can deactivate the virtualenv if you activated it by pressing `CTRL+z`.
  Most of the time, launching _cfbridge_ again from the same terminal doesn't connect to crazyflie, this can be solved by closing the terminal and relaunching _cfbridge_ in a new terminal.

:::tip
If you change any driver in [crazyflie-lib-python](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-lib-python) or if launching _cfbridge_ in a new terminal does not find crazyflie, you can try navigating to the crazyflie-lib-python folder and run the script below to rebuild cflib.

```sh
make venv
```

:::

::: info
The Joystick menu in QGC, only appears after you connect the controller to the PC (for example a Playstation 3 controller).

:::

## Hardware Setup

Crazyflie 2.1 is only able to fly in [Stabilized mode](../flight_modes_mc/manual_stabilized.md).

In order to log flight details, you can mount SD card deck on top of crazyflie as shown below:

![Crazyflie SDCard](../../assets/flight_controller/crazyflie21/crazyflie21_sd.jpeg)

## Using FrSky Taranis RC Transmitter as Joystick

If you already own a Taranis RC transmitter and want to use it as a controller, it can be configured as a USB Joystick:

- Create a new model in Taranis.

  ![Taranis - new model](../../assets/flight_controller/crazyflie/taranis_model.jpg)

- In _MODEL SETUP_ menu page, turn off both internal and external TX modules.

  ![Taranis - model setup](../../assets/flight_controller/crazyflie/taranis_model_setup.jpg)

- In _OUTPUTS_ menu page (also called “SERVOS” page in some Taranis transmitters), invert Throttle (CH1) and Aileron (CH3).

  ![Taranis - outputs](../../assets/flight_controller/crazyflie/taranis_outputs.jpg)

To use Taranis switches to arm/disarm and switch to different flight modes:

- In Taranis UI _MIXER_ menu page, you can assign the switches to any channel in the range channel 9-16 which map to the buttons 0-7 in the QGroundControl Joystick setup. For example, Taranis “SD” switch can be set to channel 9 in Taranis UI:

  ![Taranis switch setup](../../assets/flight_controller/crazyflie/taranis_switch_setup.jpg)

- Connect Taranis to PC with a USB cable and Open QGroundControl.
- In QGroundControl Joystick Setup, you can see the buttons turning yellow when you switch them on. For example, channel 9 in Taranis maps to button 0 in QGroundControl Joystick setup. You can assign any mode to this button e.g. _Altitude_ mode. Now when you lower the switch "SD", flight mode will change to _Altitude_.

### ROS

To connect to Crazyflie 2.1 via MAVROS:

- Start up _cfbridge_ using the above instructions.
- Change the UDP port QGroundControl listens to:
  - In QGroundControl, navigate to **Application Settings > General** and uncheck all the boxes under _Autoconnect to the following devices_.
  - Add in **Comm Links** a link of type _UDP_, check the _Automatically Connect on Start_ option, change the _Listening Port_ to 14557, add Target Hosts: 127.0.0.1 and then press **OK**.
- Make sure you have [MAVROS](https://github.com/mavlink/mavros/tree/master/mavros#installation) installed.
- Start MAVROS with command:

  ```sh
  roslaunch mavros px4.launch fcu_url:="udp://:14550@127.0.0.1:14551" gcs_url:="udp://@127.0.0.1:14557"
  ```

- Restart QGroundControl if it doesn't connect.
