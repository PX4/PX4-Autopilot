### ELRS Set Up

Binding your ELRS (ExpressLRS) receiver to a transmitter is a crucial step in preparing your VOXL 2 based PX4 Autonomy Developer Kit by ModalAI for flight.
This process ensures a secure and responsive connection between your drone and its control system.

Follow this guide to bind your ELRS receiver to your transmitter.

#### Setting up the Receiver

1. **Power On the Receiver**: Once your drone is powered on, you'll notice the ELRS receiver's blue LED flashing.
   This is an indication that the receiver is on but has not yet established a connection with a transmitter.

   ![Starling Receiver](../../assets/hardware/complete_vehicles/modalai_starling/starling-photo.png)

2. **Enter Binding Mode**: To initiate binding, open a terminal and execute the `adb shell` and `voxl-elrs -bind` commands.
   You'll observe the receiver's LED switch to a flashing in a heartbeat pattern, signaling that it is now in binding mode.

#### Setting up the Transmitter

1. **Access the Menu**: On your Commando 8 radio transmitter included in the kit, press the left mode button to open the menu system.

   ![Press Menu on RC](../../assets/hardware/complete_vehicles/modalai_starling/radio-1.png)

2. **Navigate to ExpressLRS**: Use the right button to select the first menu entry, which should be "ExpressLRS."
3. **Find the Bind Option**: With the "ExpressLRS" option selected, scroll down to the bottom of the menu to locate the "Bind" section. This can be done by pressing the right button downwards until you reach the "Bind" option.

4. **Initiate Binding**: Select "Bind" to put the transmitter into binding mode. You will know the process has been successful when the transmitter emits a beep, indicating a successful bind.

#### Completing the Binding Process

Once the transmitter is set to bind mode, the ELRS receiver on the drone will change its LED from flashing to a steady light, signifying a successful connection between the receiver and the transmitter.

- **Power Cycle**: After the binding process is complete, it's essential to power cycle the VOXL 2 before attempting to fly.
  This means turning off the VOXL 2 and then turning it back on.
  This step ensures that all settings are properly applied and that the system recognizes the newly established connection.

You should now have a successfully bound ELRS receiver to your transmitter, ready for use with the PX4 Autonomy Kit by ModalAI.
A secure connection is vital for the reliable operation of your drone, so always confirm the binding status before flight.
