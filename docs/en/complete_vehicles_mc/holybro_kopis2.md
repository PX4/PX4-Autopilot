## Flashing PX4 Bootloader

The _Kopis 2_ comes preinstalled with Betaflight.

Before loading PX4 firmware you must first install the PX4 bootloader.
Instructions for installing the bootloader can be found in the [Kakute F7](../flight_controller/kakutef7.md#bootloader) topic (this is the flight controller board on the _Kopis 2_).

:::tip
You can always [reinstall Betaflight](../advanced_config/bootloader_update_from_betaflight.md#reinstall-betaflight) later if you want!
:::

## Installation/Configuration

Once the bootloader is installed, you should be able to connect the vehicle to _QGroundControl_ via a USB cable.

::: info
At time of writing _Kopis 2_ is supported on the QGroundControl _Daily Build_, and prebuilt firmware is provided for the master branch only (stable releases are not yet available).
:::

To install and configure PX4:

- [Load PX4 Firmware](../config/firmware.md).
- [Set the Airframe](../config/airframe.md) to _Holybro Kopis 2_.
- Continue with [basic configuration](../config/index.md), including sensor calibration and radio setup.
