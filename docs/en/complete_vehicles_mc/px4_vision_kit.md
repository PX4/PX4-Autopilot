# PX4 Vision Autonomy Development Kit

The [_PX4 Vision Autonomy Development Kit_](https://holybro.com/collections/multicopter-kit/PX4-Vision) is a robust and inexpensive kit for enabling computer vision development on autonomous vehicles.

![Overview](../../assets/hardware/px4_vision_devkit/px4_vision_v1.5_front.png)

The kit contains a near-ready-to-fly carbon-fibre quadcopter equipped with a _Pixhawk 4_ or _Pixhawk 6C_ (on V1.5) flight controller, a _UP Core_ companion computer (4GB memory & 64GB eMMC), and a Occipital _Structure Core_ depth camera sensor.

The guide explains the minimal additional setup required to get the vehicle ready to fly (installing an RC system and battery). It also covers the first flight, and how to get started with modifying the computer vision code.


:::warning
PX4 no longer supports the avoidance software described in this document:

- [PX4/PX4-Avoidance](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Avoidance) is archived
- [Path Planning Interface](../computer_vision/path_planning_interface.md), along with obstacle avoidance in missions, and safe landing.

A USB stick is included in the kit with an example of an obstacle avoidance feature implementation based on this software.
This example is intended as a reference only and serves to demonstrate the capabilities of the platform. 
:::

::: tip
This kit is still highly recommended for developing and testing vision solutions (that don't rely on the legacy integrations).

## Warnings and Notifications

1. The kit is intended for computer vision projects that use a forward-facing camera (it does not have downward or rear-facing depth cameras).
   Consequently it can't be used (without modification) for testing features that require a downward-facing camera.
1. Obstacle avoidance in missions can only be tested when GPS is available (missions use GPS coordinates).
   Collision prevention can be tested in position mode provided there is a good position lock from either GPS or optical flow.
1. The port labeled `USB1` may jam the GPS if used with a _USB3_ peripheral (disable GPS-dependent functionality including missions).
   This is why the boot image is supplied on a _USB2.0_ memory stick.
1. PX4 Vision v1 with ECN 010 or above (carrier board RC05 and up), the _UP Core_ can be powered by either the DC plug or with battery.

   ![RC Number](../../assets/hardware/px4_vision_devkit/rc.png) ![ECN Number](../../assets/hardware/px4_vision_devkit/serial_number_update.jpg)

1. All PX4 Vision v1.5 _UP Core_ can be powered by either the DC plug or with battery.

:::warning
For PX4 Vision v1 with ECN below 010/carrier board below RC04, the _UP Core_ should only be powered using the battery (do not remove the _UP Core power_ socket safety cover). This does not apply to PX4 Vision v1.5

## What Else Do You Need

The kit contains all the essential drone hardware except a battery and a radio control system, which must be purchased separately:

- Battery:
  - 4S LiPo with XT60 female connector
  - Less than 115mm long (to fit between power connector and GPS mast)
- Radio control system
  - Any [PX4-compatible RC System](../getting_started/rc_transmitter_receiver.md) can be used.
  - An _FrSky Taranis_ transmitter with R-XSR receiver is one of the more popular setups.
- An H2.0 Hex Key (to unscrew the top plate so that an RC receiver can be connected)

In addition, users will need ground station hardware/software:

- Laptop or tablet running [QGroundControl](https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/master/en/qgc-user-guide/getting_started/download_and_install.html) (QGC).

## First-time Setup

1. Attach a [compatible RC receiver](../getting_started/rc_transmitter_receiver.md#connecting-receivers) to the vehicle (not supplied with kit):

   - Remove/unscrew the top plate (where the battery goes) using an H2.0 hex key tool.
   - [Connect the receiver to the flight controller](../assembly/quick_start_pixhawk4.md#radio-control).
   - Re-attach the top plate.
   - Mount the RC receiver on the _UP Core_ carrier board plate at the back of the vehicle (use zipties or double-sided tape).
   - Ensure the antennas are clear of any obstructions and electrically isolated from the frame (e.g. secure them under the carrier board or to the vehicle arms or legs).

1. [Bind](../getting_started/rc_transmitter_receiver.md#binding) the RC ground and air units (if not already done).
   The binding procedure depends on the specific radio system used (read the receiver manual).
1. Raise the GPS mast to the vertical position and screw the cover onto the holder on the base plate. (Not required for v1.5)

   ![Raise GPS mast](../../assets/hardware/px4_vision_devkit/raise_gps_mast.jpg)

1. Insert the pre-imaged USB2.0 stick from the kit into the _UP Core_ port labeled `USB1` (highlighted below).

   ![UP Core: USB1 Port ](../../assets/hardware/px4_vision_devkit/upcore_port_usb1.png)

1. Power the vehicle with a fully charged battery.
   ::: info
   Ensure propellers are removed before connecting the battery.
   :::
1. Connect the ground station to the vehicle WiFi network (after a few seconds) using the following default credentials:

   - **SSID:** pixhawk4
   - **Password:** pixhawk4

   :::tip
   WiFi network SSID, password, and other credentials may be changed after connecting (if desired), by using a web browser to open the URL: `http://192.168.4.1`.
   The baud rate must not be changed from 921600.
   :::

1. Start _QGroundControl_ on the ground station.
1. [Configure/calibrate](../config/index.md) the vehicle:

   ::: info
   The vehicle should arrive pre-calibrated (e.g. with firmware, airframe, battery, and sensors all setup).
   You will however need to calibrate the radio system (that you just connected) and it is often worth re-doing the compass calibration.
   :::

   - [Calibrate the Radio System](../config/radio.md)
   - [Calibrate the Compass](../config/compass.md)

1. (Optional) Configure a [Flight Mode selector switch](../config/flight_mode.md) on the remote controller.

   ::: info
   Modes can also be changed using _QGroundControl_
   :::

   We recommend RC controller switches are define for:

   - [Position Mode](../flight_modes_mc/position.md) - a safe manual flight mode that can be used to test collision prevention.
   - [Mission Mode](../flight_modes_mc/mission.md) - run missions and test obstacle avoidance.
   - [Return Mode](../flight_modes_mc/return.md) - return vehicle safely to its launch point and land.

1. Attach the propellers with the rotations as shown:

   ![Motor Order Diagram](../../assets/hardware/px4_vision_devkit/motor_order_diagram.png)

   - The propellers directions can be determined from the labels: _6045_ (normal, counter-clockwise) and _6045_**R** (reversed, clockwise).

     ![Propeller identification](../../assets/hardware/px4_vision_devkit/propeller_directions.jpg)

   - Screw down firmly using the provided propellor nuts:

     ![Propeller nuts](../../assets/hardware/px4_vision_devkit/propeller_nuts.png)

## Fly the Drone with Avoidance

When the vehicle setup described above is complete:

1. Connect the battery to power the vehicle.

1. Wait until the boot sequence completes and the avoidance system has started (the vehicle will reject arming commands during boot).

   :::tip
   The boot/startup process takes around 1 minute from the supplied USB stick (or 30 seconds from [internal memory](#install_image_mission_computer)).
   :::

1. Check that the avoidance system has started properly:

   - The _QGroundControl_ notification log displays the message: **Avoidance system connected**.

     ![QGC Log showing avoidance system has started](../../assets/hardware/px4_vision_devkit/qgc_console_vision_system_started.jpg)

   - A red laser is visible on the front of the _Structure Core_ camera.

1. Wait for the GPS LED to turn green.
   This means that the vehicle has a GPS fix and is ready to fly!
1. Connect the ground station to the vehicle WiFi network.
1. Find a safe outdoor location for flying, ideally with a tree or some other convenient obstacle for testing PX4 Vision.

1. To test [collision prevention](../computer_vision/collision_prevention.md), enable [Position Mode](../flight_modes_mc/position.md) and fly manually towards an obstacle.
   The vehicle should slow down and then stop within 6m of the obstacle (the distance can be [changed](../advanced_config/parameters.md) using the [CP_DIST](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#CP_DIST) parameter).

1. To test obstacle avoidance, create a mission where the path is blocked by an obstacle.
   Then switch to [Mission Mode](../flight_modes_mc/mission.md) to run the mission, and observe the vehicle moving around the obstacle and then returning to the planned course.

## Development using the Kit

The following sections explain how to use the kit as an environment for developing computer vision software.

### PX4 Avoidance Overview

:::warning
This feature is no [longer supported by PX4](../computer_vision/path_planning_interface.md).
:::

The _PX4 Avoidance_ system consists of computer vision software running on a companion computer (with attached depth camera) that provides obstacle and/or route information to the PX4 flight stack running on a _flight controller_.

Documentation about the companion computer vision/planning software can be found on github here: [PX4/PX4-Avoidance](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Avoidance).
The project provides a number of different planner implementations (packaged as ROS nodes):

- The PX4 Vision Kit runs the _localplanner_ by default and this is the recommended starting point for your own software.
- The _globalplanner_ has not been tested with this kit.
- The _landing planner_ requires a downward facing camera, and cannot used without first modifying the camera mounting.

PX4 and the companion computer exchange data over [MAVLink](https://mavlink.io/en/) using these interfaces:

- [Path Planning Interface](../computer_vision/path_planning_interface.md) - API for implementing avoidance features in automatic modes.
- [Collision Prevention Interface](../computer_vision/collision_prevention.md) - API for vehicle based avoidance in manual position mode based on an obstacle map (currently used for collision prevention).

<a id="install_image_mission_computer"></a>

### Installing the image on the Companion Computer

You can install the image on the _UP Core_ and boot from internal memory (instead of the USB stick).

This is recommended because booting from internal memory is much faster, frees up a USB port, and may well provide more memory than your USB stick.

::: info
Booting from internal memory takes around 30 seconds while booting from the supplied USB2 stick boots in about a minute (other cards may take several times longer).
:::

To flash the USB image to the _UP Core_:

1. Insert the pre-flashed USB drive into the _UP Core_ port labeled `USB1`.
1. [Login to the companion computer](#login_mission_computer) (as described above).
1. Open a terminal and run the following command to copy the image onto internal memory (eMMC).
   The terminal will prompt for a number of responses during the flashing process.

   ```sh
   cd ~/catkin_ws/src/px4vision_ros/tools
   sudo ./flash_emmc.sh
   ```

   ::: info
   All information saved in the _UP Core_ computer will be removed when executing this script.
   :::

1. Pull out the USB stick.
1. Restart the vehicle.
   The _UP Core_ computer will now boot from internal memory (eMMC).

### Boot the Companion Computer

First insert the provided USB2.0 stick into the _UP Core_ port labeled `USB1`, and then power the vehicle using a 4S battery.
The avoidance system should start within about 1 minute (though this does depend on the USB stick supplied).

:::tip
[Fly the Drone with Avoidance](#fly-the-drone-with-avoidance) additionally explains how to verify that the avoidance system is active.
:::

If you've already [installed the image on the companion computer](#install_image_mission_computer) you can just power the vehicle (i.e. no USB stick is needed).
The avoidance system should be up and running within around 30 seconds.

Once started the companion computer can be used both as a computer vision development environment and for running the software.

<a id="login_mission_computer"></a>

### Login to the Companion Computer

To login to the companion computer:

1. Connect a keyboard and mouse to the _UP Core_ via port `USB2`:

   ![UP Core: USB2](../../assets/hardware/px4_vision_devkit/upcore_port_usb2.png)

   - Use the USB-JST cable from the kit to get a USB A connector

     ![USB to JST cable](../../assets/hardware/px4_vision_devkit/usb_jst_cable.jpg)

   - A USB hub can be attached to the cable if the keyboard and mouse have separate connectors.

1. Connect a monitor to the _UP Core_ HDMI port.

   ![UP Core: HDMI port](../../assets/hardware/px4_vision_devkit/upcore_port_hdmi.png)

   The Ubuntu login screen should then appear on the monitor.

1. Login to the _UP Core_ using the credentials:

   - **Username:** px4vision
   - **Password:** px4vision

### Developing/Extending PX4 Avoidance

The PX4 Vision's _UP Core_ computer provides a complete and fully configured environment for extending PX4 Avoidance software (and more generally, for developing new computer vision algorithms using ROS 2).
You should develop and test your software on the vehicle, sync it to your own git repository, and share any fixes and improvements with the wider PX4 community on the github [PX4/PX4-Avoidance](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Avoidance) repo.

The catkin workspace is at `~/catkin_ws`, and is preconfigured for running the PX4 avoidance local planner.
The launch-from-boot file (`avoidance.launch`) is in the `px4vision_ros` package (modify this file to change what planner is launched).

The avoidance package is started on boot.
To integrate a different planner, this needs to be disabled.

1. Disable the avoidance process using the following command:

   ```sh
   systemctl stop avoidance.service
   ```

   You can simply reboot the machine to restart the service.

   Other useful commands are:

   ```sh
   # restart service
   systemctl start avoidance.service

   # disable service (stop service and do not restart after boot)
   systemctl disable avoidance.service

   # enable service (start service and enable restart after boot)
   systemctl enable avoidance.service
   ```

1. The source code of the obstacle avoidance package can be found in https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Avoidance which is located in `~/catkin_ws/src/avoidance`.

1. Make changes to the code! To get the latest code of avoidance pull the code from the avoidance repo:

   ```sh
   git pull origin
   git checkout origin/master
   ```

1. Build the package

   ```sh
   catkin build local_planner
   ```

The ROS workspace is placed in `~/catkin_ws`.
For reference on developing in ROS and using the catkin workspace, see the [ROS catkin tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials).

### Developing PX4 Firmware

You can modify PX4 itself, and [install it as custom firmware](../config/firmware.md#custom):

- You will need to connect _QGroundControl_ to the kit's _Pixhawk_ **via USB** in order to update firmware.
- Select the _PX4 Vision DevKit_ airframe after loading new firmware:
  ![Airframe Selection - PX4 Vision DevKit](../../assets/hardware/px4_vision_devkit/qgc_airframe_px4_vision_devkit_platform.jpg)
