# Holybro QAV250 + Pixhawk 4 Mini Build (Discontinued)

::: info
The _Holybro Pixhawk 4 Mini QAV250 Kit_ is no longer available.

The instructions have been left here because very similar kits based on the Pix32 v6 are [available here](https://holybro.com/products/qav250-kit).
These instructions can therefore still be followed (and might be updated to Pix32 v6).
:::

The complete kits include a carbon-fibre QAV250 racing frame, flight controller and almost all other components needed (except battery and receiver).
There are variants of the kit both with and without FPV support.
This topic provides full instructions for building the kit and configuring PX4 using *QGroundControl*.

Key information

- **Frame:** Holybro QAV250
- **Flight controller:** [Pixhawk 4 Mini](../flight_controller/pixhawk4_mini.md)
- **Assembly time (approx.):** 3.5 hours (2 for frame, 1.5 autopilot installation/configuration)

1. Put the nuts on the 15mm screws (shown next step)
1. Insert the plastic screws into the indicated holes (note that this part of the frame faces down when the vehicle is complete).
   ![QAV250 Add nuts to 15mm screws and put  plastic nuts in holes](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/qav250_holybro_pixhawk4_mini/3_nuts_screws_holes.jpg)
1. Add the plastic nuts to the screws (turn over, as shown)
   ![QAV250 Plastic nuts onto screws](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/qav250_holybro_pixhawk4_mini/4_plastic_nuts_on_screws.jpg)
1. Lower the power module over the plastic screws and then add the plastics standoffs
   ![QAV250 Add power module and standoffs](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/qav250_holybro_pixhawk4_mini/5_power_module_on_screws.jpg)
1. Put the flight controller plate on the standoffs (over the power module)
   ![QAV250 Add flight controller plate](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/qav250_holybro_pixhawk4_mini/6_flight_controller_plate.jpg)
1. Attach the motors. The motors have an arrow indicating the direction of rotation.
   ![QAV250 Add motors](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/qav250_holybro_pixhawk4_mini/7_motors.jpg)
1. Use double sided tape from kit to attach the *Pixhawk 4 Mini* to the flight controller plate.
   ![QAV250 Add doublesided tape](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/qav250_holybro_pixhawk4_mini/8_double_sided_tape_controller.jpg)
1. Connect the power module's "power" cable to *Pixhawk 4 mini*.
   ![QAV250 Power Pixhawk](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/qav250_holybro_pixhawk4_mini/9_power_module_power_pixhawk.jpg)
1. Attach the aluminium standoffs to the button plate
   ![QAV250 Aluminium standoffs](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/qav250_holybro_pixhawk4_mini/10_aluminium_standoffs.jpg)
1. Connect the Esc’s with the motors and hold. In this image shown the order of the motors and direction of the rotation.
   ![QAV250 Connect ESCs](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/qav250_holybro_pixhawk4_mini/11_escs.jpg)

   Connect the motors on the ESC’s, make sure the motors turns to the correct side, if the motor turns of the opposite side change the cable A to the pad C and C to the pad A of the ESC.
   
   :::warning
   Test motor directions with propellers removed.
   :::
   
   ![QAV250 Connect ESCs to Power](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/qav250_holybro_pixhawk4_mini/11b_escs.jpg)
1. Connect the signal ESC cables to the PWM outputs of the Pixhawk in the correct order (see previous image)

   ![QAV250 Connect ESCs to Pixhawk PWM](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/qav250_holybro_pixhawk4_mini/12_escs_pixhawk.jpg)
1. Connect the receiver. 
   * If using a PPM receiver connect to the PPM port.
   
     ![QAV250 Connect Receiver PPM](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/qav250_holybro_pixhawk4_mini/13_rc_receiver_ppm.jpg)
   * If using the SBUS receiver connect to the RC IN port
   
     ![QAV250 Connect Receiver SBUS](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/qav250_holybro_pixhawk4_mini/13_rc_receiver_sbus.jpg)
1. Connect the telemetry module. Paste the module with double tape and connect on the port of the telemetry.

   ![QAV250 Telemetry module](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/qav250_holybro_pixhawk4_mini/14_telemetry.jpg)
1. Connect the GPS module

   ![QAV250 Connect GPS](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/qav250_holybro_pixhawk4_mini/15a_connect_gps.jpg)

   Attach the module on the top plate (using provided 3M tape, or paste). Then put the top plate on the standoffs as shown
   
   ![QAV250 Connect GPS](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/qav250_holybro_pixhawk4_mini/15b_attach_gps.jpg)
1. The last "mandatory" assembly step is to add the velcro to hold the battery

   ![QAV250 Velcro battery strap](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/qav250_holybro_pixhawk4_mini/16_velcro_strap.jpg)


The "basic" frame build is now complete (though if you need them, you can find more information about connecting components in the [Pixhawk 4 Wiring Quickstart](../assembly/quick_start_pixhawk4.md)). 

If you have the "basic" version of the kit, you can now jump ahead to instructions on how to [Install/Configure PX4](#px4-configuration).


### FPV Assembly

The "Complete" version of the kit additionally comes with an FPV system, which is mounted on the front of the vehicle as shown.

![QAV250 FPV Attach](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/qav250_holybro_pixhawk4_mini/fpv_camera.jpg)

The steps to install the kit are:

1. Install the camera bracket on the frame
   ![Camera Connection](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/qav250_holybro_pixhawk4_mini/fpv_camera_bracket.jpg)
1. Install the camera on the bracket
   ![Camera on Bracket](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/qav250_holybro_pixhawk4_mini/fpv_camera_on_bracket.jpg)
1. The power module on the complete kit comes with wiring ready to connect the Video Transmitter and Camera:
   ![Connecting FPV](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/qav250_holybro_pixhawk4_mini/fpv_connection_board.jpg)
   - Attach the camera connector
     ![Camera Connection](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/qav250_holybro_pixhawk4_mini/fpv_camera_connection.jpg)
     The wires are: blue=voltage sensor, yellow=video out, black=ground, red=+voltage.
   - Connect the Video Transmitter (VTX) connector
   ![Video Transmitter Connection](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/qav250_holybro_pixhawk4_mini/fpv_video_transmitter_connection.jpg)
     The wires are: yellow=video out, black=ground, red=+voltage.
1. Secure the Video Transmitter and OSD board to the frame using tape.

::: info
If you have to wire the system yourself, the diagram below shows all the connections between camera, VTX and power module:

## PX4 Configuration

*QGroundControl* is used to install the PX4 autopilot and configure/tune it for the QAV250 frame.
[Download and install](http://qgroundcontrol.com/downloads/) *QGroundControl* for your platform.

:::tip
Full instructions for installing and configuring PX4 can be found in [Basic Configuration](../config/index.md).
:::

First update the firmware, airframe, and actuator mappings:

- [Firmware](../config/firmware.md)
- [Airframe](../config/airframe.md)
  
  ::: info
  You will need to select the *HolyBro QAV250* airframe (**Quadrotor x > HolyBro QAV250**).

  ![QGC - Select HolyBro QAV250 airframe](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/qav250_holybro_pixhawk4_mini/qgc_airframe_holybro_qav250.png)
  :::
  
- [Actuators](../config/actuators.md)
  - You should not need to update the vehicle geometry (as this is a preconfigured airframe).
  - Assign actuator functions to outputs to match your wiring.
    - For the Pixhawk 4 Mini, and other controllers that do not have an [I/O board](../hardware/reference_design.md#main-io-function-breakdown), you will need to assign actuators to outputs on the `PWM AUX` tab in the configuration screen.
    - The Pix32 v6 has an I/O board, so you can assign to either AUX or MAIN.    
  - Test the configuration using the sliders.

Then perform the mandatory setup/calibration:

- [Sensor Orientation](../config/flight_controller_orientation.md)
- [Compass](../config/compass.md)
- [Accelerometer](../config/accelerometer.md)
- [Level Horizon Calibration](../config/level_horizon_calibration.md)
- [Radio Setup](../config/radio.md)
- [Flight Modes](../config/flight_mode.md)

Ideally you should also do:

- [ESC Calibration](../advanced_config/esc_calibration.md)
- [Battery Estimation Tuning](../config/battery.md)
- [Safety](../config/safety.md)


## Tuning

Airframe selection sets *default* autopilot parameters for the frame.
These may be good enough to fly with, but you should tune each frame build.

For instructions on how, start from [Autotune](../config/autotune_mc.md).
