# DIY Builds (Multicopter)

Do-it-yourself (DIY) builds describe how to assemble a vehicle from parts that are sourced separately.

::: info
[Kits](../frames_multicopter/kits.md) provide a gentler introduction to building a drone, and should be considered if you are just starting out!

Note that some parts used in the builds linked below may no longer be available.
Consider it part of the challenge to find adequate replacement parts!
:::

At the easier end of the scale of DIY builds are those that take an existing RC vehicle and graft on a flight controller.
At the harder end of the scale are "unique" vehicles where some parts may be fabricated using a 3D printer.
Somewhere in the middle are builds that use separate but readily available components: frame, motors, ESC, propellers, flight controller, and so on.
