## Changes

### Common

- **RTL Trigger based on remaining flight range ([PR#16399](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16399))**
  - Calculates time to home, on RTL, taking into account vehicle speed, wind speed, and destination distance/direction
- **Pre-emptive geofence breach ([PR#16400](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16400))**
  - Triggers a breach if the _predicted_ current trajectory will result in a breach, allowing the vehicle to be re-routed to a safe hold position.
- **Airframe Scripts**
  - The syntax for setting defaults was changed and custom scripts require an update
  - See [PR#16796](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16796/files#diff-dcf2f5536f47f260e5e0ff3b3fd22eaef6b6c510126463d70affa0eb7bd4d3ddL20) for an example.
- Safety (switch) defaults to off (motors are disarmed, but servos / flaps can move)
- Safety switch is latching: Once it is disabled, it will stay disabled
- Land detector: Expand land detection to use the ground distance if a distance sensor is present
- Added support for IRC Ghost including telemetry

### Sensors

- Magnetometer calibration faster and more robust
  - new soft iron calibration coefficients
  - automatically determine the rotation of external sensors
- Optimized rate control sensor pipeline (minimal inner loop end-to-end latency)

These are removed:

### MAVLink

- **MAVLink Ethernet configuration ([PR#14460](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/14460))**
  - MAVLink Ethernet channel settings such as UDP port, remote port and broadcast mode now can be changed dynamically via parameters.
- **Support for querying `COMPONENT_INFORMATION` ([PR#16039](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16039))**
  - Parameter metadata is now automatically synchronized in combination with QGC daily.
  - This new message allows any MAVLink system to request rich hierarchical information from an autopilot, i.e., to understand which commands are supported in missions or to get parameter metadata. This message was introduced primarily to help GCS better understand autopilots (RFC: [mavlink#1339](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink/issues/1339))

### Commander

- **Commander: use control mode flags and cleanup arm/disarm ([PR#16266](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16266))**
  - Consolidate scattered arming requirements in arm_disarm(), and, keeps the `vehicle_control_mode` last state in commander
- **Commander: Separate out manual control setpoint processing ([PR#16878](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16878))**
  - Adds a new class `ManualControl` for handling `manual_control_setpoint` and handles RC loss, RC override, and RC arming/disarming

### Multicopter

- **More intuitive stick feel in Position mode**

  - Horizontal stick input mapped to acceleration instead of velocity setpoints
  - Removes unexpected tilt changes upon reaching travel speed velocity
  - Intuitive shunting e.g. when landing
  - Opt out possible using [MPC_POS_MODE](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#MPC_POS_MODE)
  - Development: [First attempt](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/12072), [Introduction](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16052), [Improvements](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16320), [Bugfix zero oscillation](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16786), [Bugfix position unlock](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16791), [Bugfix invalid setpoint](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/17078), [Bugfix high velocity pre takeoff](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/17437)

- **Hover thrust independent velocity control gains**

  - Parameters `MPC_{XY/Z}_VEL_{P/I/D}` were replaced with `MPC_{XY/Z}_VEL_{P/I/D}_ACC`, see:
    [MPC_XY_VEL_P_ACC](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#MPC_XY_VEL_P_ACC), [MPC_XY_VEL_I_ACC](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#MPC_XY_VEL_I_ACC), [MPC_XY_VEL_D_ACC](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#MPC_XY_VEL_D_ACC), [MPC_Z_VEL_P_ACC](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#MPC_Z_VEL_P_ACC), [MPC_Z_VEL_I_ACC](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#MPC_Z_VEL_I_ACC), [MPC_Z_VEL_D_ACC](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#MPC_Z_VEL_D_ACC)

    :::warning The gains have a new meaning

    - Scale from velocity error in $m/s$ to acceleration output in $m/s^2$
    - Existing gains need to roughly be rescaled by a factor of: $gravitational \_ constant / hover\_thrust$
    - Automatic parameter transition assumes 50% hover thrust: `~10m/s^2 / 50% = 20 m/s^2`.
      See [question](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/14823#issuecomment-791357646)
      :::

  - Development: [Logic introduction](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/14749), [Parameter replacement](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/14823)

- **Improve Rounded Turns ([PR#16376](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16376))**
  - Creates a more rounded turn at waypoints in multirotor missions (using L1-style guidance logic in corners)
  - See [Mission Mode > Inter-waypoint Trajectory](../flight_modes_fw/mission.md#rounded-turns-inter-waypoint-trajectory) and [Mission > Setting Acceptance/Turning Radius](../flying/missions.md#setting-acceptance-turning-radius)
- **Removal of Rattitude flight mode ([PR#17019](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/17019))**
  - Let us know if you want it back.

### VTOL

- **RTL improvements ([PR#16377](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16377))**
  - Hardens the RTL safety failsafes taking into consideration the many edge cases when trying to land, depending on the current vehicle mode (Multicopter vs Fixed-wing)
- Fixed-wing / VTOL significant TECS improvements

### Control

- **Dynamic Notch Filter updated with Gyro FFT ([PR#16385](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16385))**
  - Adds dynamic notch filtering to the gyro control data resulting in much smoother control
- **Multi-EKF enabled by default** on stm32f7 and stm32h7 boards

### GPS

- The GPS protocol now defaults to u-blox for faster startup, and [GPS_x_PROTOCOL](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#GPS_1_PROTOCOL) needs to be changed if another GPS is used.

### NuttX

Nuttx was upgraded from [8.2+ to NuttX 10.10.0+](https://github.com/apache/incubator-nuttx/compare/nuttx-8.2..nuttx-10.0.1) (@ [904a602c74dc08a100b5c2bd490807de19e73e10](https://github.com/apache/incubator-nuttx/commit/904a602c74dc08a100b5c2bd490807de19e73e10))

    ::: info
    This Knob will cycle through the correct*
    values from low to high. To avoid damaging
    the crystal. We want to use the lowest setting
    that gets the OSC running. See app note AN2867
    *It will take into account the rev of the silicon
    and use the correct code points to achieve the drive
    strength. See Eratta ES0392 Rev 7 2.2.14 LSE oscillator
    driving capability selection bits are swapped.
