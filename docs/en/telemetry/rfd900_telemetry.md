# RFD900 Long-Range Telemetry

[jDrones](http://store.jDrones.com) and [RFDesign](http://rfdesign.com.au/) offer _long-range_ [SiK](../telemetry/sik_radio.md)-compatible telemetry radios.
The radios provide reliable connectivity at greater than 5km ranges with normal antennas (and have been reported to achieve much greater ranges).

:::tip
_jDrones_ have productized _RFDesign_ modems (added a casing with power management, filtering and other electronics inside, along with cables to connect to popular flight controllers, and individually validated antennas).
The first such modem was the _RFD900_, but both _RFDesign_ and _jDrones_ have since iterated to new versions.
:::

The _jDrones_ radios have a JST-GH connector, and come with cables for: _JST-GH to JST-GH_ and _JST-GH to DF-13_. They can therefore be used in a "plug-n-play" way with most [Pixhawk Series](../flight_controller/pixhawk_series.md) controllers (you might have to change/use an appropriate connector for some "non-standard" boards).
