## PX4 Configuration

The CUAV P8 Radio comes pre-configured (baud rate 57600, broadcast mode) for use with PX4.
It should require no additional setup if connected to `TELEM1` OR `TELEM2`.

On some flight controllers, or if used with a different serial port, you may need to [configure the port for MAVLink communication](../peripherals/mavlink_peripherals.md).

Connect the CUAV P8 Radio to the `TELEM1`/`TELEM2` interface of the flight controller and use a battery or BEC to power the module.
The required cables are included in the package.

:::tip
CUAV P8 Radio does not support power supply from the flight controller, it needs to be connected to a 12~60v battery or BEC.
