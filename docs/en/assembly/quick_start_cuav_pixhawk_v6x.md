## Vehicle Front

::: info
If the controller cannot be mounted in the recommended/default orientation (e.g. due to space constraints) you will need to configure the autopilot software with the orientation that you actually used: [Flight Controller Orientation](../config/flight_controller_orientation.md).
:::

![front](../../assets/flight_controller/cuav_pixhawk_v6x/quickstart_02.jpg)

## GPS + Compass + Buzzer + Safety Switch + LED

The Pixhawk<sup>&reg;</sup> V6X can be purchased with a [NEO3 GPS](https://store.cuav.net/shop/neo-3/) (10-pin connector) and should be connected to the **GPS1** port.
These GNSS modules feature an integrated compass, safety switch, buzzer and LEDs.

If you need to use assisted GPS, connect to the **GPS2** port.

The GPS/compass should be [mounted on the frame](../assembly/mount_gps_compass.md) as far away from other electronics as possible, with the direction markings towards the front of the vehicle (separating the compass from other electronics will reduce interference).

![GPS](../../assets/flight_controller/cuav_pixhawk_v6x/quickstart_03.jpg)

::: info
Pixhawk V6X<sup>&reg;</sup> is not compatible with NEO V2 GPS built-in buzzer: you should use [NEO3/NEO 3Pro](https://store.cuav.net/shop/neo-3/) instead.
The GPS module's integrated safety switch is enabled _by default_ (when enabled, PX4 will not let you arm the vehicle).
To disable the safety press and hold the safety switch for 1 second.
You can press the safety switch again to enable safety and disarm the vehicle (this can be useful if, for whatever reason, you are unable to disarm the vehicle from your remote control or ground station).
:::

## Radio Control

A remote control (RC) radio system is required if you want to _manually_ control your vehicle (PX4 does not require a radio system for autonomous flight modes).

You will need to [select a compatible transmitter/receiver](../getting_started/rc_transmitter_receiver.md) and then _bind_ them so that they communicate (read the instructions that come with your specific transmitter/receiver).

- Spektrum/DSM receivers connect to the **DSM/SBUS** input.
- PPM receivers connect to the **PPM** input port.

For more information about selecting a radio system, receiver compatibility, and binding your transmitter/receiver pair, see: [Remote Control Transmitters & Receivers](../getting_started/rc_transmitter_receiver.md).

![RC control](../../assets/flight_controller/cuav_pixhawk_v6x/quickstart_04.jpg)

## Power

Pixhawk V6X<sup>&reg;</sup> is equipped with a CAN PMU lite module that supports 3~14s lithium battery.
Connect the 6pin connector of the module to the flight control **Power C1** or **Power C2** interface.

![Power](../../assets/flight_controller/cuav_pixhawk_v6x/quickstart_05.jpg)

_Pixhawk V6X_ power port receives Dronecan digital signal from CAN PMU lite power module for voltage, current and remaining battery data, the VCC line must provide at least 3A continuous current and should default to 5.2V.
A lower voltage of 5V is still acceptable but discouraged.

## Telemetry (Radio) System

[Telemetry radios](../telemetry/index.md) may be used to communicate and control a vehicle in flight from a ground station (for example, you can direct the UAV to a particular position, or upload a new mission).

The vehicle-based radio should be connected to the **TELEM1**/**TELEM2**/**TELEM3** port as shown below (if connected to **TELEM1**, no further configuration is required).
The other radio is connected to your ground station computer or mobile device (usually by USB).

You can also purchase telemetry radios from the [CUAV store](https://store.cuav.net/uav-telemetry-module/).

![Telemetry radios](../../assets/flight_controller/cuav_pixhawk_v6x/quickstart_06.jpg)

## SD Card

SD cards are highly recommended as they are required for [recording and analyzing flight details](../getting_started/flight_reporting.md), running tasks and using UAVCAN bus hardware.
An SD card is already installed on Pixhawk V6X<sup>&reg;</sup> when it leaves the factory.

:::tip
For more information see [Basic Concepts > SD Cards (Removable Memory)](../getting_started/px4_basic_concepts.md#sd-cards-removable-memory).
:::

## Motors/Servo

Motors/servos are connected to the **M1~M8** (**MAIN**) and **A1~A8** (**AUX**) ports in the order specified for your vehicle in the [Airframe Reference](../airframes/airframe_reference.md).

![Motors](../../assets/flight_controller/cuav_pixhawk_v6x/quickstart_07.jpg)

::: info
The **MAIN** outputs in the PX4 firmware are mapped to the Pixhawk V6X's M1~M8 ports (from IO), while the **AUX outputs** are mapped to the A1~A8 ports (from the FMU).
For example, **MAIN1** maps to M1 pin and **AUX1** maps to A1 pin.
This reference lists the output port to motor/servo mapping for all supported air and ground frames (if your frame is not listed in the reference then use a "generic" airframe of the correct type).
:::

:::warning
The mapping is not consistent across frames (e.g. you can't rely on the throttle being on the same output for all plane frames).
Make sure to use the correct mapping for your vehicle.
:::

## Servo Power Supply

Pixhawk V6X<sup>&reg;</sup> does not supply power to the servos.
If using a plane or rover, an external BEC (e.g., BEC-equipped ESC or separate 5V BEC or 2S LiPo battery) needs to be connected to any of the power (+) pins in M1~M8/A1~A8 to drive the servos .

![servo power supply](../../assets/flight_controller/cuav_pixhawk_v6x/quickstart_08.jpg)

::: info
The power rail voltage must be appropriate for the servo being used!
