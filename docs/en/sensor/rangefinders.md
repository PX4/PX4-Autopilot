# Distance Sensors (Rangefinders)

Distance sensors provide distance measurement that can be used for [terrain following](../flying/terrain_following_holding.md#terrain_following), [terrain holding](../flying/terrain_following_holding.md#terrain_hold) (i.e. precision hovering for photography), improved landing behaviour ([conditional range aid](../advanced_config/tuning_the_ecl_ekf.md#conditional-range-aiding)), warning of regulatory height limits, collision prevention, etc.

This section lists the distance sensors supported by PX4 (linked to more detailed documentation), and provides information about the [generic configuration](#configuration) required for all rangefinders, [testing](#testing), and simulation with [Gazebo](#gazebo-simulation) or [Gazebo-Classic](#gazebo-classic-simulation).
More detailed setup and configuration information is provided in the topics linked below (and sidebar).

## Supported Rangefinders

::: tip
This is a subset of the rangefinders that can be used with PX4.
[Modules: Distance Sensors](../modules/modules_driver_distance_sensor.md) lists PX4 drivers for other non-CAN rangefinders.
There may also be other DroneCAN rangefinders than those listed here.

Others may be supported via the [RaccoonLab Cyphal and DroneCAN Rangefinder Adapter](#raccoonlab-cyphal-and-dronecan-rangefinder-adapter) described below.

PX4 also supports the [LightWare LiDAR SF45 Rotating Lidar](../sensor/sf45_rotating_lidar.md) for [collision prevention](../computer_vision/collision_prevention.md) applications.

### TeraRanger Rangefinders

[TeraRanger](../sensor/teraranger.md) provide a number of lightweight distance measurement sensors based on infrared Time-of-Flight (ToF) technology.
They are typically faster and have greater range than sonar, and smaller and lighter than laser-based systems.

## Configuration/Setup {#configuration}

Rangefinders are usually connected to either a serial (PWM) or I2C port (depending on the device driver), and are enabled on the port by setting a particular parameter.

The hardware and software setup that is _specific to each distance sensor_ is covered in their individual topics.

The generic configuration that is _common to all distance sensors_, covering both the physical setup and usage, is given below.

### Generic Configuration

The common rangefinder configuration is specified using [EKF2_RNG\_\*](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_RNG_CTRL) parameters.
These include (non exhaustively):

- [EKF2_RNG_POS_X](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_RNG_POS_X), [EKF2_RNG_POS_Y](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_RNG_POS_Y), [EKF2_RNG_POS_Z](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_RNG_POS_Z) - offset of the rangefinder from the vehicle centre of gravity in X, Y, Z directions.
- [EKF2_RNG_PITCH](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_RNG_PITCH) - A value of 0 degrees (default) corresponds to the range finder being exactly aligned with the vehicle vertical axis (i.e. straight down), while 90 degrees indicates that the range finder is pointing forward.
  Simple trigonometry is used to calculate the distance to ground if a non-zero pitch is used.
- [EKF2_RNG_DELAY](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_RNG_DELAY) - approximate delay of data reaching the estimator from the sensor.
- [EKF2_RNG_SFE](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_RNG_SFE) - Range finder range dependent noise scaler.
- [EKF2_RNG_NOISE](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_RNG_NOISE) - Measurement noise for range finder fusion

## Testing

The easiest way to test the rangefinder is to vary the range and compare to the values detected by PX4.
The sections below show some approaches to getting the measured range.

### QGroundControl MAVLink Inspector

The _QGroundControl MAVLink Inspector_ lets you view messages sent from the vehicle, including `DISTANCE_SENSOR` information from the rangefinder.
The main difference between the tools is that the _Analyze_ tool can plot values in a graph.

::: info
The messages that are sent depend on the vehicle configuration.
You will only get `DISTANCE_SENSOR` messages if the connected vehicle has a rangefinder installed and is publishing sensor values.
:::

To view the rangefinder output:

1. Open the menu **Q > Select Tool > Analyze Tools**:

   ![Menu for QGC Analyze Tool](../../assets/qgc/analyze/menu_analyze_tool.png)

1. Select the message `DISTANCE_SENSOR`, and then check the plot checkbox against `current_distance`.
   The tool will then plot the result:
   ![QGC Analyze DISTANCE_SENSOR value](../../assets/qgc/analyze/qgc_analyze_tool_distance_sensor.png)

### QGroundControl MAVLink Console

You can also use the _QGroundControl MAVLink Console_ to observe the `distance_sensor` uORB topic:

```sh
listener distance_sensor 5
```

::: info
The _QGroundControl MAVLink Console_ works when connected to Pixhawk or other NuttX targets, but not the Simulator.
On the Simulator you can run the commands directly in the terminal.
:::

For more information see: [Development > Debugging/Logging > Sensor/Topic Debugging using the Listener Command](../debug/sensor_uorb_topic_debugging.md).

## Simulation

### Gazebo Simulation

Lidar and sonar rangefinders can be used in the [Gazebo](../sim_gazebo_gz/index.md) simulator.
To do this you must start the simulator using a vehicle model that includes the rangefinder.

Downward facing sensors that write to the [DistanceSensor](../msg_docs/DistanceSensor.md) UORB topic can be used to test use cases such as [landing](../flight_modes_mc/land.md) and [terrain following](../flying/terrain_following_holding.md):

- [Quadrotor(x500) with 1D LIDAR (Down-facing)](../sim_gazebo_gz/vehicles.md#x500-quadrotor-with-1d-lidar-down-facing)

  ```sh
  make px4_sitl gz_x500_lidar_down
  ```

Front-facing sensors that write to [ObstacleDistance](../msg_docs/ObstacleDistance.md) can be used to test [Collision Prevention](../computer_vision/collision_prevention.md#gazebo-simulation):

- [Quadrotor(x500) with 2D LIDAR](../sim_gazebo_gz/vehicles.md#x500-quadrotor-with-2d-lidar)

  ```sh
  make px4_sitl gz_x500_lidar_2d
  ```

- [Quadrotor(x500) with 1D LIDAR (Front-facing)](../sim_gazebo_gz/vehicles.md#x500-quadrotor-with-1d-lidar-front-facing)

  ```sh
  make px4_sitl gz_x500_lidar_front
  ```

### Gazebo-Classic Simulation

Lidar and sonar rangefinders can be used in the [Gazebo Classic](../sim_gazebo_classic/index.md) simulator.
To do this you must start the simulator using a vehicle model that includes the rangefinder.

The iris optical flow model includes a Lidar rangefinder:

```sh
make px4_sitl gazebo-classic_iris_opt_flow
```

The typhoon_h480 includes a sonar rangefinder:

```sh
make px4_sitl gazebo-classic_typhoon_h480
```

If you need to use a different vehicle you can include the model in its configuration file.
You can see how in the respective Iris and Typhoon configuration files:

- [iris_opt_flow.sdf](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-SITL_gazebo-classic/blob/main/models/iris_opt_flow/iris_opt_flow.sdf)

  ```xml
    <include>

  ```
