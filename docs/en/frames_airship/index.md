# Airships

<LinkedBadge type="warning" text="Experimental" url="../airframes/#experimental-vehicles"/>

:::warning
Support for airships is [experimental](../airframes/index.md#experimental-vehicles).
Maintainer volunteers, [contribution](../contribute/index.md) of new features, new frame configurations, or other improvements would all be very welcome!
:::

PX4 supports a single airship geometry with starboard, port and tail thrusters, and a thrust tilt server.
The frame configuration is shown in [Airframes Reference > Airship](../airframes/airframe_reference.md#airship).
