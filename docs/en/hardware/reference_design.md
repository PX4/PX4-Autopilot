# PX4 Reference Flight Controller Design

The PX4 reference design is the [Pixhawk series](../flight_controller/pixhawk_series.md) of flight controllers. First released in 2011, this design is now in its 5th [generation](#reference_design_generations) (with the 6th generation board design in progress).

## Binary Compatibility

All boards manufactured to a particular design are expected to be binary compatible (i.e. can run the same firmware). From 2018 we will offer a binary compatibility test suite that will allow us to verify and certify this compatibility.

FMU generations 1-3 were designed as open hardware, while FMU generations 4 and 5 provided only pinout and power supply specifications (schematics were created by individual manufacturers). In order to better ensure compatibility, FMUv6 and onward will return to a complete reference design model.

## Main/IO Function Breakdown

The diagram below shows the division of bus and functional responsibilities between the FMU and I/O boards in a Pixhawk-series flight controller (the boards are incorporated into a single physical module).

Some Pixhawk-series controllers are built without the I/O board in order to reduce space or complexity, or to better address certain board use-cases.
In this case the I/O driver is not started.

::: info
Manufacturer flight controller variants without an I/O board are often named as a "diminutive" of a version that includes the I/O board: e.g. _Pixhawk 4_ **Mini**_, \_CUAV v5 **nano**_.
:::

Build targets that must run on flight controllers with an I/O board map the FMU outputs to `AUX` and the I/0 outputs to `MAIN` (see diagram above).
If the target is run on hardware where I/O board is not present or has been disabled, the PWM MAIN outputs will not be present.
You might see this, for example, by running `px4_fmu-v5_default` on [Pixhawk 4](../flight_controller/pixhawk4.md) (with IO) and [Pixhawk 4 Mini](../flight_controller/pixhawk4_mini.md) (without I/O).

:::warning
On [Pixhawk 4 Mini](../flight_controller/pixhawk4_mini.md) this results in a mismatch between the `MAIN` label screenprinted on the flight controller and the `AUX` bus shown during [Actuator Configuration](../config/actuators.md).
::: info that if a build target is only ever intended to run on a flight controller that does not have an I/0 board, then the FMU outputs are mapped to `MAIN` (for example, the `px4_fmu-v4_default` target for [Pixracer](../flight_controller/pixracer.md)).

PX4 PWM outputs are mapped to either `MAIN` or `AUX` ports in [Actuator Configuration](../config/actuators.md).
