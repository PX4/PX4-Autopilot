# Test MC_06 - Optical Flow

## Objective

To test that optical flow / external vision work as expected

## Preflight

Disconnect all GPS / compasses and ensure vehicle is using optical flow for navigation

Ensure that the drone can go into Altitude, Position mode while still on the ground

## Flight Tests

❏ Altitude

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❏ Vertical position should hold current value with stick centered

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❏ Pitch/Roll/Yaw response 1:1

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❏ Throttle response set to Climbs/Descend rate

❏ Position

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❏ Horizontal position should hold current value with stick centered

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❏ Vertical position should hold current value with stick centered

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❏ Throttle response set to Climbs/Descend rate

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❏ Pitch/Roll/Yaw response set to Pitch/Roll/Yaw rates

❏ Landing

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❏ Land in Position mode with the throttle below 40%
