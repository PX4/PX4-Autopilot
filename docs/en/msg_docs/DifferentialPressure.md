# DifferentialPressure (UORB message)

Differential-pressure (airspeed) sensor

This is populated by airspeed sensor drivers and used by the sensor module to calculate airspeed.
The information is published in the `SCALED_PRESSURE_n` MAVLink messages (along with information from a corresponding `SensorBaro` instance).
