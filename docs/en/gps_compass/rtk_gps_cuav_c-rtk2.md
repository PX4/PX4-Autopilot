# CUAV C-RTK2 GNSS Module (RTK/PPK)

The [CUAV C-RTK2 receiver](https://www.cuav.net/en/c_rtk_9ps/) is a high-performance PPK/RTK positioning module created by CUAV for professional applications such as drone aerial surveying and mapping.
It has a high-precision IMU and positioning module, and can reduce the number of required [control points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k7v5aXyuKQ) by more than to 80%.
In addition to surveying/mapping, it is suitable for many other use-cases, including: agricultural plant protection and drone swarms.
