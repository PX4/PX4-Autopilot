# Holybro M8N & M9N GPS

The GPS includes either a M8N or M9N UBLOX module, IST8310 compass, tri-colored LED indicator, and a safety switch.

There are 3 different connector options, allowing easy connection to flight controllers that are compliant with the Pixhawk-connector standard as either a primary or secondary GPS.
This module ships with a baud rate of 38400 Hz.

The main difference between the modules is that the M8N allows concurrent reception of up to 3 GNSS systems, while M9N can concurrently connect to up to 4.
