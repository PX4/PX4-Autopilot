# HEX/ProfiCNC Here+ RTK GPS (Discontinued)

<Badge type="info" text="Discontinued" />

::: info
This GPS is no longer available for purchase but is still compatible with PX4.

Usage documentation can be found in [PX4v1.11 docs](https://docs.px4.io/v1.11/en/gps_compass/rtk_gps_hex_hereplus.html)
:::

The **Here+ RTK GPS receiver** is a small, light and energy efficient [RTK GPS module](../gps_compass/rtk_gps.md), based on the u-blox M8P. Using RTK, PX4 can get its position with centimetre-level accuracy, which is much more accurate than can be provided by a normal GPS.
