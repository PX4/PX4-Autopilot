# DATAGNSS GEM1305 RTK Receiver with antenna

GEM1305 is a RTK receiver with antenna designed and manufactured by [DATAGNSS](https://www.datagnss.com/).

GEM1305 is based on the new generation CYNOSURE IV dual-core GNSS SoC.
It supports RTK functionality with a maximum data update rate of 10Hz, and comes with cables for connecting to GPS ports on most Pixhawk devices.

## Pinout

The board is connected to the autopilot via UART interface.

![GEM1305 connector](../../assets/hardware/gps/datagnss_gem1305/gem1305_connector.png)

The 1.25mm pitch 6P connector (from left: PIN1 to PIN6):

- 1: GND
- 2: NC
- 3: PPS
- 4: Rx
- 5: Tx
- 6: 5V

The board does not include a compass and so does not require connections for a compass part.

## Hardware Setup

RTK requires a base RTK module attached to the ground station, and a rover RTK module on the vehicle.
The data from the base needs to be transmitted to the drone via telemetry radio and inputed into the RTK receiver on the rover.

![RTK setup overview](../../assets/hardware/gps/datagnss_gem1305/setup_overview.png)

The setup/connections for base and rover modules are shown below.

### Base Setup (GCS)

The base station connections are shown in the diagram below, along with the connection to a telemetry radio.

![Base module setup](../../assets/hardware/gps/datagnss_gem1305/base_gnss_setup.png)

Note that for the base we recommend the [NANO RTK Receiver](https://www.datagnss.com/collections/gnss-for-drone/products/multi-band-rtk-receiver-package) because it is easier to setup.

See to [How to setup Base station](https://wiki.datagnss.com/index.php/GEM1305-autopilot#Base_station_setup) for information on how to configure the module for use as a base station (not including step 6 and later, for which you would QGroundControl instead of Mission Planner).

### Rover Setup (PX4)

The rover setup showing connections to a GPS port and the (required) connection to a telemetry radio are shown in the diagram below.

![Rover module and pixhawk big picture connections](../../assets/hardware/gps/datagnss_gem1305/rover_gnss_setup.png)

The diagram below shows the wiring from the `GPS2` port on the Pixhawk 6c flight controller.
Note that an appropriate cable is supplied for this purpose.

GPS and RTK configuration on PX4 via _QGroundControl_ is plug and play (see [RTK GPS](../gps_compass/rtk_gps.md) for more information).
