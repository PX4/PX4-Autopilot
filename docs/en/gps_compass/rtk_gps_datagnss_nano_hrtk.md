# DATAGNSS NANO HRTK receiver

NANO HRTK receiver is a RTK receiver designed and manufactured by [DATAGNSS](https://www.datagnss.com/).

It is a high performance dual-band RTK receiver with compass, which is based on CYNOSURE series chipset. It supports global civil navigation systems, including GPS, BDS, GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS, and SBAS.

NANO HRTK receiver support compass. It is designed for UAV, RTK, and other applications.

## Hardware Setup

RTK requires a base RTK module attached to the ground station, and a rover RTK module on the vehicle.
The data from the base needs to be transmitted to the drone via telemetry radio and inputed into the RTK receiver on the rover.

![RTK setup overview](../../assets/hardware/gps/datagnss_nano_hrtk/setup_overview.png)

The setup/connections for base and rover modules are shown below.

### Base Setup (GCS)

The base station connections are shown in the diagram below, along with the connection to a telemetry radio.

Note that for the base we recommend the [NANO RTK Receiver](https://www.datagnss.com/collections/gnss-for-drone/products/multi-band-rtk-receiver-package) because it is easier to setup.

See to [How to setup Base station](https://wiki.datagnss.com/index.php/GEM1305-autopilot#Base_station_setup) for information on how to configure the module for use as a base station (not including step 6 and later, for which you would QGroundControl instead of Mission Planner).

### Rover Setup (PX4)

The rover setup showing connections to a GPS port and the (required) connection to a telemetry radio are shown in the diagram below.

![Rover module and pixhawk big picture connections](../../assets/hardware/gps/datagnss_nano_hrtk/rover_gnss_setup.png)

The diagram below shows the wiring from the `GPS2` port on the Pixhawk 6c flight controller.
Note that an appropriate cable is supplied for this purpose.

GPS and RTK configuration on PX4 via _QGroundControl_ is plug and play (see [RTK GPS](../gps_compass/rtk_gps.md) for more information).
