## What gets discussed?

We publish a forum post per meeting a week before the call on [PX4 Discuss - weekly-dev-call](https://discuss.px4.io/c/weekly-dev-call) and track the agenda write down the discussion for the day. We welcome any topics that you, as a community member may have questions about / want to discuss!

Please add your topics for discussion to the agenda before the meeting begins, by replying to the meeting note. This will help you formulate your questions more clearly, and allow us to think about them in advance.
