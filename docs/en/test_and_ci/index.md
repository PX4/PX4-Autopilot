Live flight testing is also performed by the development team and the broader community.

- [Unit Tests](../test_and_ci/unit_tests.md)
- [Continuous Integration (CI)](../test_and_ci/continous_integration.md)
- [ROS Integration Testing](../test_and_ci/integration_testing.md)
- [MAVSDK Integration Testing](../test_and_ci/integration_testing_mavsdk.md)
