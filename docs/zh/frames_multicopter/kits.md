# Kit Builds (Multicopter)

Multicopter kits contain almost all the parts needed for building a PX4-compatible vehicle.

They provide a gentle introduction to building drones, as all the parts are known to work well together.

:::tip
Batteries not included!
Kits generally do not include:

- **Batteries** — shipping regulations mean that these must usually be source separately
- **RC Controllers** — Transmitters/receivers are not included in kit builds to save costs.
  Many users already have a handheld ground unit, and this will need a compatible module on the vehicle.

## Build Guides

The build guides below show how to assemble a number of kits.
Many kits vary only a little between revisions (for example, the new kit might simply upgrade the flight controller used, and is otherwise identical), so these are likely to be be useful for building the kits in the section above.
