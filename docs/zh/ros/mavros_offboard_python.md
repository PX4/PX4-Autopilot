# MAVROS _Offboard_ control example (Python)

This tutorial shows the basics of _OFFBOARD_ control with MAVROS Python, using an Iris quadcopter simulated in [Gazebo Classic](../sim_gazebo_classic/index.md).
该教程提供分步指示，说明如何开始开发控制无人机以及在仿真环境中运行代码。

在教程结束时，你应该看到与下面的视频相同的行为, 即缓慢起飞到2米的高度。

:::warning
_OFFBOARD_ control is dangerous.
如果你是在一个真正的无人机平台上进行试验，请保证你已经设置了切换回手动的开关来防止紧急情况的发生。

## 创建ROS包

1. Open the terminal and go to `~/catkin_ws/src` directory

   ```sh
   roscd  # Should cd into ~/catkin_ws/devel
   cd ..
   cd src
   ```

2. In the `~/catkin_ws/src` directory create a new package named `offboard_py` (in this case) with the `rospy` dependency:

   ```sh
   catkin_create_pkg offboard_py rospy
   ```

3. Build the new package in the `~/catkin_ws/` directory:

   ```sh
   cd .. # Assuming previous directory to be ~/catkin_ws/src
   catkin build
   source devel/setup.bash
   ```

4. 您现在应该能够通过使用以下方法切换至包目录：

   ```sh
   roscd offboard_py
   ```

5. To store your Python files, create a new folder called `/scripts` on the package:

   ```sh
   mkdir scripts
   cd scripts
   ```

## 代码

After creating the ROS package and scripts folder you are ready to start your Python script.
Inside the scripts folder create the `offb_node.py` file and give it executable permissions:

```sh
touch offb_node.py
chmod +x offb_node.py
```

After that, open `offb_node.py` file and paste the following code:

```py
"""
 * File: offb_node.py
 * Stack and tested in Gazebo Classic 9 SITL
"""

#! /usr/bin/env python

import rospy
from geometry_msgs.msg import PoseStamped
from mavros_msgs.msg import State
from mavros_msgs.srv import CommandBool, CommandBoolRequest, SetMode, SetModeRequest

current_state = State()

def state_cb(msg):
    global current_state
    current_state = msg


if __name__ == "__main__":
    rospy.init_node("offb_node_py")

    state_sub = rospy.Subscriber("mavros/state", State, callback = state_cb)

    local_pos_pub = rospy.Publisher("mavros/setpoint_position/local", PoseStamped, queue_size=10)

    rospy.wait_for_service("/mavros/cmd/arming")
    arming_client = rospy.ServiceProxy("mavros/cmd/arming", CommandBool)

    rospy.wait_for_service("/mavros/set_mode")
    set_mode_client = rospy.ServiceProxy("mavros/set_mode", SetMode)


    # Setpoint publishing MUST be faster than 2Hz
    rate = rospy.Rate(20)

    # Wait for Flight Controller connection
    while(not rospy.is_shutdown() and not current_state.connected):
        rate.sleep()

    pose = PoseStamped()

    pose.pose.position.x = 0
    pose.pose.position.y = 0
    pose.pose.position.z = 2

    # Send a few setpoints before starting
    for i in range(100):
        if(rospy.is_shutdown()):
            break

        local_pos_pub.publish(pose)
        rate.sleep()

    offb_set_mode = SetModeRequest()
    offb_set_mode.custom_mode = 'OFFBOARD'

    arm_cmd = CommandBoolRequest()
    arm_cmd.value = True

    last_req = rospy.Time.now()

    while(not rospy.is_shutdown()):
        if(current_state.mode != "OFFBOARD" and (rospy.Time.now() - last_req) > rospy.Duration(5.0)):
            if(set_mode_client.call(offb_set_mode).mode_sent == True):
                rospy.loginfo("OFFBOARD enabled")

            last_req = rospy.Time.now()
        else:
            if(not current_state.armed and (rospy.Time.now() - last_req) > rospy.Duration(5.0)):
                if(arming_client.call(arm_cmd).success == True):
                    rospy.loginfo("Vehicle armed")

                last_req = rospy.Time.now()

        local_pos_pub.publish(pose)

        rate.sleep()

```

## 代码解释

The `mavros_msgs` package contains all of the custom messages required to operate services and topics provided by the MAVROS package.
All services and topics as well as their corresponding message types are documented in the [mavros wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/mavros).

```py
import rospy
from geometry_msgs.msg import PoseStamped
from mavros_msgs.msg import State
from mavros_msgs.srv import CommandBool, CommandBoolRequest, SetMode, SetModeRequest
```

我们创建了一个简单的回调函数来储存飞控当前的状态。
This will allow us to check connection, arming and _OFFBOARD_ flags.:

```py
current_state = State()

def state_cb(msg):
    global current_state
    current_state = msg
```

我们构建了一个发布者来发布本地位置指令并请求客户端进行加解锁状态及控制模式的切换。
请注意，对于您自己的系统，"mavros" 前缀可能不同，取决于节点启动文件中指定的名称。

```py
state_sub = rospy.Subscriber("mavros/state", State, callback = state_cb)

local_pos_pub = rospy.Publisher("mavros/setpoint_position/local", PoseStamped, queue_size=10)

rospy.wait_for_service("/mavros/cmd/arming")
arming_client = rospy.ServiceProxy("mavros/cmd/arming", CommandBool)

rospy.wait_for_service("/mavros/set_mode")
set_mode_client = rospy.ServiceProxy("mavros/set_mode", SetMode)
```

PX4 has a timeout of 500ms between two _OFFBOARD_ commands.
If this timeout is exceeded, the commander will fall back to the last mode the vehicle was in before entering _OFFBOARD_ mode.
This is why the publishing rate **must** be faster than 2 Hz to also account for possible latencies.
This is also the same reason why it is **recommended to enter _OFFBOARD_ mode from _Position_ mode**, this way if the vehicle drops out of _OFFBOARD_ mode it will stop in its tracks and hover.

Here we set the publishing rate appropriately:

```py
# Setpoint publishing MUST be faster than 2Hz
rate = rospy.Rate(20)
```

在发布任何消息之前，我们需要等待飞控和MAVROS建立连接。
在收到心跳包之后，代码便会跳出这个循环。

```py
# Wait for Flight Controller connection
while(not rospy.is_shutdown() and not current_state.connected):
    rate.sleep()
```

Even though PX4 operates in the aerospace NED coordinate frame, MAVROS translates these coordinates to the standard ENU frame and vice-versa.
This is why we set `z` to positive 2:

```py
pose = PoseStamped()

pose.pose.position.x = 0
pose.pose.position.y = 0
pose.pose.position.z = 2
```

Before entering _OFFBOARD_ mode, you must have already started streaming setpoints.
否则，模式切换将被拒绝。
Below, `100` was chosen as an arbitrary amount.

```py
# Send a few setpoints before starting
for i in range(100):
    if(rospy.is_shutdown()):
        break

    local_pos_pub.publish(pose)
    rate.sleep()
```

We prepare the message request used to set the custom mode to `OFFBOARD`.
A list of [supported modes](http://wiki.ros.org/mavros/CustomModes#PX4_native_flight_stack) is available for reference.

```py
offb_set_mode = SetModeRequest()
offb_set_mode.custom_mode = 'OFFBOARD'
```

The rest of the code is largely self explanatory.
We attempt to switch to _Offboard_ mode, after which we arm the quad to allow it to fly.
我们每隔五秒去调用一次该服务，避免飞控被大量的请求阻塞。
In the same loop, we continue sending the requested pose at the rate previously defined.

```py
arm_cmd = CommandBoolRequest()
arm_cmd.value = True

last_req = rospy.Time.now()

while(not rospy.is_shutdown()):
    if(current_state.mode != "OFFBOARD" and (rospy.Time.now() - last_req) > rospy.Duration(5.0)):
        if(set_mode_client.call(offb_set_mode).mode_sent == True):
            rospy.loginfo("OFFBOARD enabled")

        last_req = rospy.Time.now()
    else:
        if(not current_state.armed and (rospy.Time.now() - last_req) > rospy.Duration(5.0)):
            if(arming_client.call(arm_cmd).success == True):
                rospy.loginfo("Vehicle armed")

            last_req = rospy.Time.now()

    local_pos_pub.publish(pose)

    rate.sleep()
```

:::tip
This code has been simplified to the bare minimum for illustration purposes.
在一个复杂的系统中，通常需要创建新的进程来负责周期性的发送位置期望值给飞控。
:::

## 创建ROS启动文件

In your `offboard_py` package, create another folder inside the `~/catkin_ws/src/offboard_py/src` directory named `launch`.
This is where your launch files for the package will be stored.
After that, create your first launch file, in this case we will call it `start_offb.launch`.

```sh
roscd offboard_py
mkdir launch
cd launch
touch start_offb.launch
```

For the `start_offb.launch` copy the following code:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<launch>
	<!-- Include the MAVROS node with SITL and Gazebo -->
	<include file="$(find px4)/launch/mavros_posix_sitl.launch">
	</include>

	<!-- Our node to control the drone -->
	<node pkg="offboard_py" type="offb_node.py" name="offb_node_py" required="true" output="screen" />
</launch>
```

As you can see, the `mavros_posix_sitl.launch` file is included.
This file is responsible for launching MAVROS, the PX4 SITL, the Gazebo Classic Environment and for spawning a vehicle in a given world (for further information see the file [here](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/main/launch/mavros_posix_sitl.launch)).

:::tip
The `mavros_posix_sitl.launch` file takes several arguments that can be set according to your preferences such as the vehicle to spawn or the Gazebo Classic world (refer to [here](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/main/launch/mavros_posix_sitl.launch)) for a complete list).

You can override the default value of these arguments defined in `mavros_posix_sitl.launch` by declaring them inside the _include_ tags.
As an example, if you wanted to spawn the vehicle in the `warehouse.world`, you would write the following:

```xml
<!-- Include the MAVROS node with SITL and Gazebo -->
<include file="$(find px4)/launch/mavros_posix_sitl.launch">
    <arg name="world" default="$(find mavlink_sitl_gazebo)/worlds/warehouse.world"/>
</include>
```

:::

## 启动您的脚本

If everything is done, you should now be able to launch and test your script.

In the terminal write:

```sh
roslaunched offboard_py start_offb.launch
```

You should now see the PX4 firmware initiating and the Gazebo Classic application running.
After the _OFFBOARD_ mode is set and the vehicle is armed, the behavior shown in the [video](#offb_video) should be observed.

:::warning
It is possible that when running the script an error appears saying:

> Resource not found: px4
> ROS path [0] = ...
> ...

This means that PX4 SITL was not included in the path.
To solve this add these lines at the end of the `.bashrc` file:

```sh
source ~/PX4-Autopilot/Tools/simulation/gazebo/setup_gazebo.bash ~/PX4-Autopilot ~/PX4-Autopilot/build/px4_sitl_default
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:~/PX4-Autopilot
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:~/PX4-Autopilot/Tools/simulation/gazebo-classic/sitl_gazebo-classic
export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=$GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gazebo-9/plugins
```

Now in the terminal, go to the home directory and run the following command to apply the changes above to the current terminal:

```sh
source .bashrc
```

After this step, every time you open a new terminal window you should not have to worry about this error anymore.
If it appears again, a simple `source .bashrc` should fix it.
This solution was obtained from this [issue](https://github.com/mzahana/px4_fast_planner/issues/4) thread, where you can get more information about the problem.
