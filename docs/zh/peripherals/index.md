This section contains topics about peripheral hardware that can be connected to a flight controller (not including [cameras and other payloads](../payloads/index.md)).

The peripherals are not _required_ for flight, but may support it by providing improved safety, or allowing the vehicle to meet regulartory requirements:

- [ADSB/FLARM/UTM (Traffic Avoidance)](../peripherals/adsb_flarm.md)
- [Parachute](../peripherals/parachute.md)
- [Remote ID](../peripherals/remote_id.md)
