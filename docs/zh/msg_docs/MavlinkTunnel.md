uint64 timestamp	     # Time since system start (microseconds)
uint16 payload_type      # A code that identifies the content of the payload (0 for unknown, which is the default). If this code is less than 32768, it is a 'registered' payload type and the corresponding code should be added to the MAV_TUNNEL_PAYLOAD_TYPE enum. Software creators can register blocks of types as needed. Codes greater than 32767 are considered local experiments and should not be checked in to any widely distributed codebase.

uint8 payload_length     # Length of the data transported in payload
uint8[128] payload       # Data itself
