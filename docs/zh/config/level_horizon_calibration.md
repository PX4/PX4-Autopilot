# 水平平面校准

You can use _Level Horizon Calibration_ to compensate for small misalignments in controller orientation and to level the horizon in the _QGroundControl_ flight view (blue on top and green on bottom).

:::tip
Performing this calibration step is only recommended if the autopilot's orientation is visibly misaligned with the specified orientation, or if there is a constant drift during flight in not position-controlled flight modes.
:::

## 执行校准

To level the horizon:

1. Start _QGroundControl_ and connect the vehicle.

2. Select the **Gear** icon (Vehicle Setup) in the top toolbar and then **Sensors** in the sidebar.

3. Click the **Level Horizon** button.

   ::: info
   You should already have set the [Autopilot Orientation](../config/flight_controller_orientation.md). If not, you can also set it here.

:::

4. Place the vehicle in its level flight orientation on a level surface:

   - For planes this is the position during level flight (planes tend to have their wings slightly pitched up!)
   - For copters this is the hover position.

5. Press **OK** to start the calibration process.

6. Wait until the calibration process is finished.

## 验证

Check that the artificial horizon displayed in the flight view has the indicator in the middle when the vehicle is placed on a level surface.
