## 综述

1. Can serve as a basic flight platform, paired with Pixhawk 6C flight controller to achieve optical flow and GPS fusion positioning, enabling stable flight both indoors and outdoors.
   It is one of the most stable basic flight platforms on the market.
2. Sturdy and reliable structure, with key parts made of aluminium alloy and carbon fibre, high strength and not easily damaged.
3. High stability, providing industrial-grade stability assurance, friendly to beginners, offering simplified version of interactive PC to enhance flight experience, can be initially used for outdoor aerial photography and image collection.
4. Has rich open-source code support, and can be used with PX4, FMT, and ArduPilot.
5. Video can be streamed from the UAV webcam to QGroundControl.
6. The drone has a lot of room and support for expansion, including for adding on-board computers, range sensors, and other payloads.
   - Compatibility with many different components, providing platform for loading other user sensors, preparing for functional model development.
   - Abundant power supply making it perfect for installing additional sensors and onboard computers (including 5 external output voltages, 3 channels of 5V, 2 channels of 12V).
   - Pc-SDK support.
      This is a PC-based Python SDK Library based on MAVSDK that significantly simplifies UAV development compared to other approaches, such as using ROS or using C++. All you need is a basic understanding of Python programming and some simple coordinate system principles!
   - The [documentation](https://docs.amovlab.com/f450-v6c-wiki/#/en/) shows many of the options.
7. Quasi-smart battery. The battery has a hard housing design that makes easy to install and remove.
   It provides accurate power estimates, but does not have some more advanced "smart battery" features.

## Upgrading

Amovlab previously supplied this vehicle with PX4 v1.13.

In order to upgrade to PX4 v1.15, you should select the [X500 airframe](../config/airframe.md) and import [this parameter file](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/main/docs/assets/airframes/multicopter/amovlab_f410/amovlabf410_drone_v1.15.4.params) to apply the new [actuator output configuration](../config/actuators.md) (used from PX4 v1.14).
Then retune as necessary.

Contact Amovlab for information about upgrading to other versions.
