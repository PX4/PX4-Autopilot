 *
 *   work_usrthread:  This is a user mode work queue.  It must be built into
 *     the applicatino blob during the user phase of a kernel build.  The
 *     user work thread will then automatically be started when the system
 *     boots by calling through the pointer found in the header on the user
 *     space blob.
 *
 *   All of these entrypoints are referenced by OS internally and should not
 *   not be accessed by application logic.
