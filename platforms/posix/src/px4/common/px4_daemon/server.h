/**
 * @file server.h
 *
 * The server (also called daemon) opens a socket for clients to connect to.
 *
 * Once a client connects it will send a command and close its side of the connection.
 * The server will return the stdout of the executing command, as well as the return
 * value to the client.
 *
 * There should only every be one server running, therefore the static instance.
 * The Singleton implementation is not complete, but it should be obvious not
 * to instantiate multiple servers.
