# Three possible main power battery sources for BBBlue:
# 1. onboard 2S LiPo battery connector, which is connect to ADC channel 6
# 2. onboard 9-18V DC Jack, which is connect to ADC channel 5. This is the board default.
# 3. other power source (e.g., LiPo battery more than 4S/18V).
#    Scale the voltage to below 1.8V and connect it to ADC channel # 0, 1, 2 or 3.
