 * 10-8--2016:
 *  To simplify the ripple effect on the tools, we will be using
 *  /dev/serial/by-id/<asterisk>PX4<asterisk> to locate PX4 devices. Therefore
 *  moving forward all Bootloaders must contain the prefix "PX4 BL "
 *  in the USBDEVICESTRING
 *  This Change will be made in an upcoming BL release
 ****************************************************************************/
/*
 * Define usage to configure a bootloader
 *
 *
 * Constant                example          Usage
 * APP_LOAD_ADDRESS     0x08004000            - The address in Linker Script, where the app fw is org-ed
 * BOOTLOADER_DELAY     5000                  - Ms to wait while under USB pwr or bootloader request
 * BOARD_FMUV2
 * INTERFACE_USB        1                     - (Optional) Scan and use the USB interface for bootloading
 * INTERFACE_USART      1                     - (Optional) Scan and use the Serial interface for bootloading
 * USBDEVICESTRING      "PX4 BL FMU v2.x"     - USB id string
 * USBPRODUCTID         0x0011                - PID Should match defconfig
 * BOOT_DELAY_ADDRESS   0x000001a0            - (Optional) From the linker script from Linker Script to get a custom
 *                                               delay provided by an APP FW
 * BOARD_TYPE           9                     - Must match .prototype boad_id
 * _FLASH_KBYTES        (*(uint16_t *)0x1fff7a22) - Run time flash size detection
 * BOARD_FLASH_SECTORS  ((_FLASH_KBYTES == 0x400) ? 11 : 23) - Run time determine the physical last sector
 * BOARD_FLASH_SECTORS   11                   - Hard coded zero based last sector
 * BOARD_FLASH_SIZE     (_FLASH_KBYTES*1024)-   Total Flash size of device, determined at run time.
 *                         (1024 * 1024)      - Hard coded Total Flash of device - The bootloader and app reserved will be deducted
 *                                              programmatically
 *
 * BOARD_FIRST_FLASH_SECTOR_TO_ERASE  2        - Optional sectors index in the flash_sectors table  (F4 only), to begin erasing.
 *                                               This is to allow sectors to be reserved for app fw usage. That will NOT be erased
 *                                               during a FW upgrade.
 *                                               The default is 0, and selects the first sector to be erased, as the 0th entry in the
 *                                               flash_sectors table. Which is the second physical sector of FLASH in the device.
 *                                               The first physical sector of FLASH is used by the bootloader, and is not defined
 *                                               in the table.
 *
 * APP_RESERVATION_SIZE (BOARD_FIRST_FLASH_SECTOR_TO_ERASE * 16 * 1024) - Number of bytes reserved by the APP FW. This number plus
 *                                                                        BOOTLOADER_RESERVATION_SIZE  will be deducted from
 *                                                                        BOARD_FLASH_SIZE to determine the size of the App FW
 *                                                                        and hence the address space of FLASH to erase and program.
 * USBMFGSTRING            "PX4 AP"            - Optional USB MFG string (default is '3D Robotics' if not defined.)
 * SERIAL_BREAK_DETECT_DISABLED                -  Optional prevent break selection on Serial port from entering or staying in BL
 *
 * * Other defines are somewhat self explanatory.
