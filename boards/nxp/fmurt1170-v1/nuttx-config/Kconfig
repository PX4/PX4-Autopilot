config BOARD_HAS_PROBES
	bool "Board provides GPIO or other Hardware for signaling to timing analyze."
	default y
	---help---
		This board provides GPIO FMU-CH1-8, as PROBE_1-8 to provide timing signals
		from selected drivers.

config BOARD_USE_PROBES
	bool "Enable the use the board provided FMU-CH1-8 as PROBE_1-8"

config BOARD_FORCE_ALIGNMENT
	bool "Forces all acesses to be Aligned"
	default n

		Jtag from Load and be abel to reset it.

config BOARD_BOOTLOADER_FIXUP
	bool "Restores OCTAL Flash when No FCB"
	default n
	select ARCH_RAMFUNCS

	---help---
		Restores OCTAL Flash when FCB is invalid.
