NxWidgets Test Status
=====================

At this point, the NXWidgets GUI toolkit code complete but still not
completely tested.  This is a list of testing issues that still need to be
addressed.

The following Widgets have been have completed unit testing.  The level of
unit testing is, however, superficial.  Many features have not yet been
tested:

  - CLabel
  - CTextBox
  - CButton
  - CButtonArray
  - CKeypad
  - CRadioButton (and CRadioButtonGoup)
  - CGlyphButton
  - CLatchButton (and CStickyButton)
  - CLatchButtonArray (and CStickyButtonArray)
  - CCheckBox
  - CProgressBar
  - CImage
  - CSliderHorizontal (and CSliderHorizontalGrip)
  - CSliderVertical (and CSliderVerticalGrip)
  - CScrollBarHorizontal (except paging buttons)
  - CScrollBarVertical (except paging buttons)
 
The following components have unit test in place, but do not successfully
pass the test:
 
  - CListBox (and CListBoxDataItem) which also tests:
    o CText
    o CList and CListDataItem
    o CScrollingPanel
    
The following no unit tests (and, hence, are probably non-functional):

  Infrastructure (won't have their own unit tests)
  - CScrollBarPanel

  Widgets that need unit tests:   
  - CCycleButton
  - CScrollingTextBox
  - CMultiLineTextBox
  - CScrollingListBox

There are things that require testing after all widgets complete their unit
tests as well.  As examples:
   
 - Need to verify that a screen with many widgets works correctly.  That
   focus is correctly handled when widgets are removed.  etc.
 - Need to verify that widget with many children work correctly together.
 - Need to verfiy that a display with many windows with multiple wigets
   per window works okay.

Most unit-level testing was performed in a simulated environment driven by
simulated mouse and keyboard input.  So many features are not tested that
require human interaction ... such grabbing and dragging scrollbars.
