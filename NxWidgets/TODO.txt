o General NxWM Issues
  -------------------

  Title:       DISPLAY INTIALIZATION
  Description: During the initialization of the display, the basic frame of the
               start window is draw momentarily.  The is just the empty window
               frame.  This is a consequence of how NX creates windows:  The
               are enabled all of the time so the windows are visible when they
               are being created. The solution would be to add some disable
               logic in NX so that that nothing gets displayed when a window
               is created until it is fully initialized and enable.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium

  Title:       DRAGGING ACROSS WINDOWS
  Description: Need some indication if the touch/mouse drags from one window to
               another then is release.  Release event is lost in this case.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low.  ICON just stays selected and must be touched again.

  Title:       AUTO-RAISE DISABLED
  Description: Auto-raise is currently disabled in nuttx for NX multi-server
               mode.  The
               reason is complex:
               - Most touchscreen controls send touch data a high rates
               - In multi-server mode, touch events get queued in a message
                  queue.
               - The logic that receives the messages performs the auto-raise.
                 But it can do stupid things after the first auto-raise as
                 it opperates on the stale data in the message queue.
               I am thinking that auto-raise ought to be removed from NuttX
               and moved out into a graphics layer (like NxWM) that knows
               more about the appropriate context to do the autoraise.

  Title:       THREAD SAFETY
  Description: I am not sure how thread-safe the NxWidgets are.  There is
               is very little mutli-thread in the widgets now.  The "NX listener"
               thread interacts to update mouse (and keyboard) data but all
               of the heavy work is done on the "start window" thread.  I think
               everything is okay now, but it may be necessary in the future
               to introduce some semaphore protection in theCWidgetControl methods
               to make them thread safe.

o NxConsole Issues
  ----------------

  Title:       MULTIPLE COPIES OF AN NxCONSOLE
  Description: From the start window, you an create multiple copies of the
               NxConsole.  However, there is a problem in the current
               implementation:  Each NxConsole receives its input from the
               serial console so, for example, it you enter text one character
               will go to one NxConsole instance and the next character goes
               to a different instance.  That is correct behavior within the
               current design, but not very usable.  We need a mechanism to
               assure that the top window is the one that receives all 
               eyboard input.  NX already provides this capability with its
               nx_kbdin interface(), but that is not currently used.  At present,
               NxConsoles get their input from /dev/console which is the serial
               port.  The necessary change is to create an NX input device for
               /dev/console that will get its input from NX.
  Status:      Closed with was fixed with the last check of 5/20/2012 (about
               SVN version 4755).  The fixed version is available in SVN but
               won't be in a released version until NxWidgets-1.2 is released.
  Priority:    Medium high, basically prohibits the use of multiple NSH windows.
  
  Title:       CLOSING AN NxCONSOLE
  Description: If you open multiple NxConsole applications, they all receive
               serial input (as noted in the previous bug).  However, if 
               you close one of the NxConsoles, then the others no longer
               received input (or no long generate output -- that cannot be
               distinguished).
  Status:      Closed with was fixed with the last check of 5/20/2012 (about
               SVN version 4755).  The fixed version is available in SVN but
               won't be in a released version until NxWidgets-1.2 is released.
  Priority:    Medium high, basically prohibits the use of multiple NSH windows.

  Title:       DOUBLE DISPLAY UPDATES
  Description: When the NxConsole window is first opened, there are usually
               double updates, i.e., the display forms twice.
  Status:      Open
  Priorioty:   Low, this would be necessary to fix to productize the windows.

o Platform specific issues
  ------------------------

  Title:       MISSING TOUCH RELEASE
  Description: Using the STM3240G-EVAL board with the STMPE11 touchscreen, you
               will find that there are occasional missing indications of when
               you release a icon.  This is believed to be a data overrun in the
               STPMPE11 data path.  The STMPE11 generates data a very high
               rate and it is believe that it sometimes misses the interrupt
               that indicates that the touch is released.  The symptom in NxWM
               is that you touch an icon, it is highlighted but when you release
               the touch nothing happens.  The icon stays highlighted.  Touching
               the icon again usually works around this problem.
