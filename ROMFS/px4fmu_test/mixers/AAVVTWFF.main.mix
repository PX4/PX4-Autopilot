Aileron/v-tail/throttle/wheel/flaps mixer for PX4FMU
=======================================================

This file defines mixers suitable for controlling a fixed wing aircraft with
aileron, v-tail (rudder, elevator), throttle, steerable wheel and flaps
using PX4FMU.
The configuration assumes the aileron servos are connected to PX4FMU servo
output 0 and 1, the tail servos to output 2 and 3, the throttle
to output 4, the wheel to output 5 and the flaps to output 6 and 7.

Inputs to the mixer come from channel group 0 (vehicle attitude), channels 0
(roll), 1 (pitch), 2 (yaw) and 3 (thrust) 4 (flaps) 5 (spoiler).

Aileron mixer (roll + spoiler)
---------------------------------

This mixer assumes that the aileron servos are set up correctly mechanically;
depending on the actual configuration it may be necessary to reverse the scaling
factors (to reverse the servo movement) and adjust the offset, scaling and
endpoints to suit.

V-tail mixers
-------------
Three scalers total (output, roll, pitch).

On the assumption that the two tail servos are physically reversed, the pitch
input is inverted between the two servos.

Motor speed mixer
-----------------
Two scalers total (output, thrust).

This mixer generates a full-range output (-1 to 1) from an input in the (0 - 1)
range.  Inputs below zero are treated as zero.

Wheel mixer
------------
Two scalers total (output, yaw).

This mixer assumes that the wheel servo is set up correctly mechanically;
depending on the actual configuration it may be necessary to reverse the scaling
factors (to reverse the servo movement) and adjust the offset, scaling and
endpoints to suit.

Flaps mixer
------------
Flap servos are physically reversed.
